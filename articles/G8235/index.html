It is located on the famous beach of Varadero.  The hotel is suburban, so it has a fairly large territory.  It has a rather interesting story.  They say this is the former residence of Al Capone.  But since then so much water has flowed, and the requirements for the level of comfort have changed.  Of course, this is not the “four” and not the “five”, and the guest reviews are different.  There are tourists who like the hotel, and there are those who are unhappy.  But each person is subjective, so you can make up your mind about this hotel by reading our article analyzing the opinions of travelers who have been there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul Punta Blanca 2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2190552.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Varadero - the famous beach where our hotel is located - is located in the province of Matanzas, on the Ikakos Peninsula.  This is 20 kilometers of continuous sandy coast.  Havana is 135 kilometers from there.  It is not too far to drive from the Varadero international hub to the Islazul Punta Blanca 2 * hotel.  As a rule, tourist groups come here with a transfer.  Islazul Punta Blanca is most often either the first or second in line.  So you get quickly and comfortably.  Only charters fly to Varadero from Russia.  Regular flights are possible from Moscow to Havana.  From there you can get the bus carrier "Viazul".  Flights to Varadero depart four times a day.  You need to go about three and a half hours.  Planes fly from St. Petersburg with a change in Vienna or Frankfurt am Main, and then directly to Varadero. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  Islazul Punta Blanca 2 * hotel is located at the very end of the Cavana Road.  This is the very beginning of the resort of Varadero.  Next to it are two “fours” - “Bleeve Playa Caleta” and “Puntarena”.  To the center of Varadero, walk only a quarter of an hour along the beach with a calm step.  There are all night clubs and discos.  If you stay late until late, you can get back in a retro-cabriolet or in a regular taxi.  Near the hotel there is a car and scooter rental office.  Before the Cuban revolution, it was in these places that the richest people in the country lived. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul Punta Blanca 2 * (Varadero" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2190568.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Territory and rooms </h2><p>  The hotel is located in a tropical garden, and at the same time stands right on the ocean.  The whole territory is surrounded by greenery, coconut palms are everywhere, as on brochures.  Around it is very picturesque and well-groomed.  Hotel Islazul Punta Blanca 2 * is not too big.  It has only 21 rooms.  They are located in small two-story buildings, white with blue or cream with a red edging.  All rooms are of the standard type.  There is a usual set for relaxation and comfort - in-room amenities, bathroom with hairdryer, satellite TV, air conditioning ... Plumbing is good, new, in working condition.  Hot water without interruption.  There is one Russian channel on television, the rest are American.  There are two holes in the sockets, not three, so an adapter is not needed.  On the second floor there are balconies, on the first floor there are terraces.  There is a problem with the Internet, as in many places in Cuba.  But in the neighboring hotel "Puntarena" you can buy a card with a username and password.  Sometimes guests are accommodated not in the Punta Blanca, but in the Carey Club, if there are no places.  And without any surcharges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul Punta Blanca 2 Varadero" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2190573.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The concept of the Islazul Punta Blanca 2 * hotel (Varadero) is “all inclusive”.  But this is not a simple all-inclusive.  The fact is that if you are given a bracelet, then you can use the bars, restaurants and services of the neighboring hotel with three stars - “Carey Club”.  He, like Punta Blanca, belongs to the same Islazul line.  This is the policy of the administration.  According to the "all inclusive" system, they are fed in the restaurant of the "Carey Club".  And at the hotel "Punta Blanca" operates only a la carte restaurant.  Hotel bars are located on the beach and in the lobby.  You can also have lunch there - good burgers and french fries.  Tourists praise the local rum - viscous, pleasant to taste and smell.  Even women like him. </p><p>  The food at the hotel is amazing.  Very rich breakfasts - cheese, eggs, omelets, cutlets of several types, sausages.  For lunch and dinner, two types of soup, many varieties of meat, fish, seafood.  Every day a cook prepares something on the grill.  Juices are all natural.  Good pastries, cakes with natural creams, great ice cream.  The bars have great cocktails, both with and without alcohol.  Moreover, Mojito and Cuba Libre are made on the beach, and Pina Colada in the lobby.  Beer is very good, and tourists simply do not find words to describe local coffee.  Many real fruits grown nearby (bananas, guava, papaya, pineapples).  Well, if you want something exclusive, then in restaurants in the center of Varadero you will be fed with lobsters and oysters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul Punta Blanca 2 cube" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2190586.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The resort complex of Varadero is a real protected tourist city.  The police are at your service everywhere.  The safety of tourists is provided round the clock.  The ocean from the hotel Islazul Punta Blanca 2 * (Varadero, Cuba) is only 50 meters!  Water can be accessed directly from the lobby.  Own beach, sunbeds and umbrellas are free.  True, the sand is not snow-white, but grayish.  But the reason for this is the smallest seashells crushed by the sea, which are mixed with it.  The water is clear, clean, everything is visible to the smallest detail.  A beach snack bar is located right by the pool.  So, if the ocean has wind or waves, you can swim here, and even with a view of the sea.  There are plenty of water activities at the beach.  They are free for hotel guests.  Beach towels can be taken at the reception of the Karey Club Hotel, at the animator.  The water in the oceans is cool in the morning, but vacationers quickly get used to it.  And after lunch, I do not want to get out of it.  There are very few people on the beach, many even had the feeling that they were there alone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul Punta Blanca 2 Varadero Reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2190561.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What to see </h2><p>  One of the most popular excursions from the Islazul Punta Blanca 2 * hotel (Cuba) - to the island of Blanca.  It is not very far from the hotel.  You are being taken on a boat.  There is white sand on the beach, and starfish float in the ocean.  The island is surrounded by corals and is very good for snorkelling.  They also take excursions to Havana, to a crocodile farm, to the Indian village and to the Caribbean Sea, which includes a visit to the beach.  You can go to the capital of Cuba on your own, by bus.  There will be enough time to leave after breakfast and return for dinner.  Moreover, the stop is right next to the hotel.  Excursions are better not to take from tour operators, but individual.  It is both cheaper and more interesting.  Near the resort is the Varaikakos reserve with karst caves.  Tours are also organized there, although they can be visited on their own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul Punta Blanca 2 Varadero Cuba" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2190590.jpg"></div>
