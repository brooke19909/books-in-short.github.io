The INCOM Real Estate company, whose reviews are very numerous, is rightfully considered one of the most experienced on the market.  And, logically, her name is of interest not only to potential customers, but also to competitors, so there are a lot of stories regarding the quality of her work.  Let‚Äôs try to figure out whether it is true what they are talking about, or trust such stories after all is not worth it.

    <h4>  Historical reference </h4><p>  The fact is that the INCOM Real Estate company, reviews of which are highly contradictory, has been operating on the market for more than 20 years.  An ever-increasing number of offices suggests that the business is developing successfully.  A substantial number of transactions in Moscow and the region are carried out with the assistance of this company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

And it is extremely unprofitable for developers building cottages and business class houses to contact the company if the quality of the services it provides is in doubt.

    <p>  In general, any organization that has existed for such a long amount of time and has a large staff of employees would not be able to conduct its activities if it did it very badly. </p><p>  On the other hand, a large company also has its drawbacks.  Sooner or later, the so-called ‚Äúgrowth crisis‚Äù is brewing in it, when management problems that have not been known before come up.  One of them is the quality control of staff.  ‚ÄúINCOM Real Estate‚Äù, reviews of which can be found any, from enthusiastic to angry, in this case is no exception. </p><p>  Perhaps some of them are written for the purpose of advertising or anti-advertising companies.  The responses written anonymously, in which the facts are not stated, do not inspire confidence.  An opinion about something can also be the result of a bad mood, a lack of perception of the situation or the person you are talking to. </p><p>  All this can be discussed for a long time.  In fact, for someone who needs the help of a realtor company, two aspects are important: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  quality of services provided; </li><li>  their cost. </li></ul><p>  Based on the opinions of customers, you can draw some conclusions for yourself. </p><h4>  INCOM Real Estate (Moscow) - reviews on the quality of work </h4><p>  As already mentioned, the opinions of customers are contradictory.  In fact, we are not addressing the company, but to a specific person.  If the proposed realtor is not liked, you can always start working with another.  Therefore, in the event that a deal is impossible without involving an Incom employee, one should not be afraid of bad reviews.  It makes sense to find the right contact, communication with which will not cause negative emotions. </p>

    <h4>  "INCOM Real Estate" - reviews on the cost of services </h4><p>  You can find information in which the company's customers complain that they wanted to deceive them in the transaction, forcing them to pay for the assistance rendered more than it was worth it.  This fact is very unpleasant, but most likely similar information can be found about other players in this market. </p><p>  In this case, we can only advise you not to hope for someone, but carefully study all the information, including finding out the real cost of a particular service in other companies.  Better to do this than read reviews.  ‚ÄúINCOM-Real Estate‚Äù or any other company - no matter who is chosen, all responsibility will not succeed.  And you should not do this, because it is not in our interests. </p>
