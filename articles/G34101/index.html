    <p>  All rooms are simple and sophisticated.  Vacationers and tourists note how comfortable and functional rooms Kabardinka SK (family complex) can offer.  Reviews of tourists are mostly positive, which, of course, affects the rating of this option. </p><p>  The rooms show signs of fresh renovation.  The furniture here is new, quite comfortable.  Tourists like that all rooms are facing the sea, so the window offers stunning views of the local beauty.  The rooms are equipped with the necessary equipment: there is a TV with satellite channels, air conditioning or a fan (depending on the category), a minibar, a refrigerator.  The equipment is in good condition, there are no interruptions in the supply of hot water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Vacationers complain about the small size of the rooms.  So, a family of three in a standard home will be really crowded.  Of course, many relate to the choice of a hotel as a place where they will only spend the night.  But I would like more light and space - guests write in reviews. </p><p>  Another drawback is the lack of wireless Internet, even for an additional fee.  Modern tourists simply can not imagine their life without smartphones, tablets, round-the-clock communication with relatives and friends through the use of the World Wide Web.  Therefore, they will certainly be upset because of her absence. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in the family complex includes full three meals a day, organized in the dining room of the boarding house.  Vacationers say that its interior can hardly be called ultramodern, but it is quite suitable for a meal. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the guests, several types of cereal, eggs, pasta, sausages, cold cuts, cheese cakes, pancakes with cottage cheese and sour cream, coffee, tea, juices and fruit drinks are served for breakfast.  Agree that for a boarding house this menu is quite diverse.  For lunch, surely serve soup, main course, salad.  Dinner is easier.  In principle, the menu is quite balanced: eat, and meat, and fish, and fruits, and vegetables. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  If you are looking for a place that is calm and remote from major coastal resorts, Kabardinka (a family complex) is perfect for you.  Photos of tourists demonstrate a good boarding house infrastructure.  There is a disco club where all lovers of such leisure can dance and enjoy their favorite musical compositions. </p><p>  In the evening, you can stroll along the promenade, which stretches for a length of 300 meters.  Often in a boarding house conduct business conferences, seminars, training.  This is possible due to the presence of a conference room, which capacity is 30 people. </p>
