Rest and fishing in the suburbs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow is a huge metropolis with millions of people, skyscrapers, traffic jams, shopping centers and industrial enterprises.  There are not so many districts in the capital that can boast of natural beauties, comfort and silence.  One of such places is Losinoostrovsky district, where residents and visitors of the city have the opportunity to fully relax. </p><h2>  Brief description of the area </h2><p>  Losinoostrovsky district is named after the metro station of the same name located on its territory, which received its name from Losiny Ostrov.  More than 80 thousand Muscovites live here;  There are a dozen schools, 14 kindergartens, several libraries, clinics, as well as vocational schools, a college of urban planning and a medical school number 22. </p><p>  The Losinoostrovsky district is located in the north-east of the capital, its total area is 554 hectares. </p><p>  Initially, this territory was not part of Moscow.  At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, summer residents formed two villages here.  The first was called Losinoostrovsky, and the second, which arose later, was called Dzhamgarovka in honor of the Armenian brothers by the name of Dzhamgarov, who were successful Moscow bankers and also owned dachas in these places. </p><p>  In 1925, the villages turned into the city of Losinoostrovsk, later renamed Babushkin (in honor of the famous pilot).  And only in 1960, the town near Moscow was included in the capital. </p>

    <p>  Today on the territory of the Lonoostrovsky district there are several recreation areas, one of which is the Dzhamgarovsky park, which spans around the pond of the same name.  This is a real paradise that locals are rightly proud of! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The delights of Jamgar park </h2><p>  The park, which grew up on the site of the former home of the Jamgar bankers, actually looks more like a forest.  Centuries-old pine trees, linden trees, birch trees and other trees ... Where else in Moscow will you find such luxury?  But at the same time, the territory is not wild - it is ennobled and great for relaxation.  Here there are sandboxes for babies, and swings for older children, and benches with gazebos for adults, and urns, and even barbecues, where anyone can fry a barbecue.  And before all this, from apartment buildings - just a stone's throw.  It is not surprising that there are always a lot of people in the park. </p><p>  The Moscow authorities are monitoring this territory, so there are no garbage mountains here, and it's really nice to relax in the park.  But its main highlight is the Dzhamgarovsky pond. </p>

    <h2>  History, geography and other characteristics of the reservoir </h2><p>  The pond, like the park named after Moscow bankers, is well known to Muscovites who like to be on its banks.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir is 13.5 hectares, and the average depth is approximately two and a half meters.  It feeds on ground and surface waters. </p><p>  Dzhamgarovsky pond was built in the twenties of the 20th century on the site of a sand pit, which, in turn, was the result of the creation of a dam on the Ichke river.  According to one version, during the Second World War a bomb fell into a pond, because of which one of its shores now has a rounded shape.  In 1984, the pond underwent reconstruction: its banks were strengthened and landscaped, the bottom was cleaned. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, the Jamgar Pond is one of the favorite places for guests and residents of the capital.  They enjoy walking along the wooden promenade, sunbathing on a specially equipped beach (although swimming is forbidden), relaxing in a cafe on the beach, riding on gondolas and admiring the gulls, which are very numerous. </p>

    <p>  Fans of antiquity will be interested in the <span>Perlovskoe cemetery, the</span> first burial of which dates from the middle of the nineteenth century.  It is located on the coast.  And local believers are happy to visit the temple on the Dzhamgarovsky pond, which was built recently in spite of protests from some activists.  Orthodox residents of the region have been waiting for this event since 1998, and now, finally, a chapel in honor of the Iveron Icon of the Mother of God has been erected! </p><h2>  Fishing at Jamgar Pond </h2><p>  The pond also attracts the attention of those who are interested in fishing in the suburbs and the capital.  You can sit with a fishing rod on the shore of this reservoir not only pleasantly, but also productively.  According to experts, the water here is in a more or less satisfactory condition, which allows the fauna to feel good in it.  And fishermen can count on a bull, crucian carp, perch, tench, roach and even pike!  Few of them leave empty-handed. </p><p>  A big plus of fishing at the Jamgar pond is the abundance of gulls and ducks, as well as a ban on swimming. </p>

    <p>  Getting to Ichki is quite simple.  You need to get to the metro station "Ulitsa Podbelskogo".  Walk northeast to the forest.  Then go to the clearing.  The path will take about 1.5 kilometers.  With the flow you can get to the Moscow Ring Road, walk two hundred meters along the highway in a north-western direction to the clearing.  Landmark - Elk stream.  After three kilometers, it flows into the Ichka River.  Getting to it is not at all difficult, and after you get to the banks of the river, the soul rejoices in the surrounding beauty of nature. </p><p>  The Jamgar pond and the park around it, the Ichka river with picturesque banks and clear water - this is the real property of Muscovites, which they try to protect like the apple of an eye. </p>
