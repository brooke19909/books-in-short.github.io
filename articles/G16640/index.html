As a rule, full-time cars cannot boast good sound, so it‚Äôs better to do this kind of work yourself.  During the construction of the audio system, perhaps the main task is to create a so-called sound stage in the car, on which the images will be clearly localized and perfectly focused.  Usually the rear location of the subwoofer significantly complicates the formation of sound in the <span>low-frequency</span> region <span>.</span>  If the low-frequency parameters are incorrectly set and set incorrectly, the overall melody may be destroyed, and the sound of instruments with a low and medium range will fly around the cabin.  Can this be avoided?  How to make sure that the bass in the car was installed correctly? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bass in the car" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/338694.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Sound theorem </h2><p>  In theory, the easiest method is to install a subwoofer in the front of your cabin.  Only in this case, the emitter will be located next to the midrange and tweeter speakers, and the alignment of the sound scene will be significantly simplified.  Quite often, they do just that.  Professionals are well aware of all the advantages of this particular solution.  They are even ready to accept some difficulties, for example, the rather complicated process of creating an irregularly shaped case.  However, an ordinary lover of sound is not capable of such a task.  Does this mean that you should be content with a subwoofer that always buzzes and delivers strange bass to the car?  Of course not. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bass for your car" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/338693.jpg" width="400"></div>

Acoustics researchers note that in the region below 700 Hz, the temporary localization of the sound source is triggered.  This ultimately leads to the fact that our brain perceives the difference in the time of arrival of the acoustic signal to the right and, accordingly, to the left ear of a person.  If such an effect is not observed, then it seems to the listener that the <span>sound source is</span> located directly opposite it, and a sharp increase in the difference indicates a shift relative to the center.  This localization scheme works well in the upper bass and in the lower middle. </p><p>  Now let's look at what will happen when we install the speakers.  What bass will the car give out?  During medium frequencies, <span>sound waves</span> will begin to form <span>.</span>  They will spread throughout the car, bounce off the walls of the passenger compartment and begin to interact with each other.  With decreasing frequency limits, wave propagation will begin to decline.  However, let's not go deep into the physics of all these processes, let's talk about more accessible and understandable things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bass in the car 2013" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/338692.jpg?1392741033014" width="300"></div>

Car audio experts do not recommend purchasing ready-made and cheap boxes that are abundant in the markets.  These boxes are usually made of very thin plywood, which is simply not suitable for working with powerful low-frequency sound-reproducing equipment, since such a case quickly begins to vibrate and rattle during operation.  Really high-quality box can be built using strong, uniform and solid materials.  It is best to use MDF and HDF for this.  Keep in mind that the walls of the case must have a thickness of at least 2 centimeters, if there is more, it is even better. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bass in the car" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/338691.jpg?1392741067885" width="395"></div>

    <h2>  The thicker the better </h2><p>  Ideally, the front wall should reach 70 millimeters and the side supports should be 40 mm.  To further strengthen the structural strength, spacers between the walls should be used.  When purchasing a case, be sure to tap it.  If in response you hear a loud response, such a box will not work, and if the sound is muffled, then this is exactly what we need.  Feel free to purchase such a housing and install it in a car.  With it, the bass for your car will be saturated and truly high quality.  However, this is not all.  Keep in mind that such enclosures themselves can be sources of sound distortion, especially if unsuccessful calculations were made during the design. </p><h2>  A bit about the salon </h2><p>  In order to get a good bass, it‚Äôs not enough to assemble a cool subwoofer enclosure, you must also correctly configure the filter division frequency.  An unsuccessful box can become a source of extraneous sound, approximately the same thing happens with loose parts located inside the car.  Do not forget about this when preparing your car for mounting an audio system.  Of course, the bass in the car of 2013, that is, in the "fresh", has not yet realized what Russian roads are, it is easier to install than on a used car.  It has less poorly fixed parts, more technological and advanced materials are used, therefore the sound is more saturated and deep. </p>
