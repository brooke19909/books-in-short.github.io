    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Very close to the shores of the Adriatic Sea is Hotel Quisisana 3 *.  Italy, Rimini - one of the most popular resorts, has always been famous for its excellent beaches.  For some tourists, it is somewhat unusual that the coastline in Rimini, stretching over 15 km, is divided into numbered sections (from 1 to 100), but in practice it is quite convenient.  So, Quisisana 3 * belongs to plot number 52.  This means that anyone can relax there, but for hotel guests, upon presentation of a card, there are discounts.  The beach is paid.  Money in the amount of 15 euros must be paid every day in a small office located at the very entrance to the beach.  For guests of Quisisana 3 * this amount is less by 5 euros, but places at the water's edge are more expensive.  Beach workers take vacationers to free sunbeds under umbrellas (independent choice of location is not practiced here).  For the money paid, you can not only comfortably sunbathe, but also play volleyball, tennis, participate in animation programs, and children can have fun on a swing-carousel.  The beach closes at 8 in the evening, but no one expels anyone, as reported in the reviews by Quisisana 3 * guests.  Italy is a country that is serious about the state of its beaches, so they are clean and comfortable here.  Italians haven‚Äôt decided to settle down for free on their towels, but you can just walk along the shore, which many locals and visitors do.  The beach cover No. 52 is sandy, the entry into the water is smooth, the depth starts 100 meters from the water's edge, and at these 100 meters there are places where the water can be ankle-deep.  The sea at this resort is warm, but not very transparent.  The beach infrastructure is excellent.  There are changing cabins, showers, bars, music all day, lifeguards working. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Quisisana 3" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1521853.jpg" width="507"></div>
