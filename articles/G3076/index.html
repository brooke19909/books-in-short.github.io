    <p>  Dolphinarium in Yalta is visited by a lot of people.  Qualified workers take care of their safety in water.  Therefore, in case of unforeseen situations in the pool, it is necessary to follow the instructions of experienced trainers.  But none of the visitors so far complained about the lack of professionalism of the institution. </p><h2>  Contact with children </h2><p>  Children from 3 to 6 years old require adult support.  Those who have already rested in the complex report that they charge for two.  In addition to observing elementary rules of conduct, customers are prohibited from harming animals.  But you can stroke and swim with them. </p><p>  Dolphinarium in Yalta has one more minus - time.  The countdown starts when the client enters the water.  However, not every child can immediately admit a marine inhabitant.  Your child, for example, may immediately be afraid of the muzzle or loud breathing of a large creature. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, guests note: in order not to spend precious minutes establishing contact between the baby and the dolphin, you should first explain to the peanut that the animal is absolutely safe.  If the child does not want to go to the pool, then it is better to immediately abandon this thought. </p><h2>  Therapy courses </h2><p>  But very few children are afraid of marine animals.  Thousands of schoolchildren who have a rest in such a wonderful city like Yalta dream of getting into the "Water Area".  Dolphinarium welcomes everyone. </p><p>  Has special programs "Water Area" for children with disabilities.  Guests note that the techniques that employees offer are simple but work.  Courses are provided for children with autism, cerebral palsy and Down syndrome.  For such persons, professionals select only calm animals.  Parents note that the kids immediately make contact with friendly dolphins. </p><p>  Each client is approached individually, taking into account his medical history and communication features.  Therefore, after the sessions, the kids become more open and ready to communicate with the world. </p>

    <h2>  Fun all year round </h2><p>  At the height of the season, prices are just cosmic.  Very expensive city of Yalta.  Dolphinarium "Water Area" pleases visitors with low prices before and after the end of the holiday months.  Crimea is a unique peninsula, it is fun and interesting to relax on it not only in summer but also in winter. </p><p>  For those who will rest in Yalta from October to May, there are significant discounts.  But guests note that you should first contact the administration to clarify the information.  For example, for residents of Crimea, the ticket price will be minimal, but they need to bring a passport with a residence permit.  A photocopy of the document is also accepted.  You can buy a ticket only at the box office of the theater.  The cost starts from 300 rubles. </p><p>  Even in cold weather, Yalta does not freeze.  Dolphinarium works indoors in winter.  Reviews note that the temperature in the hall and in the pool is comfortable.  Workers try to keep indicators at the following levels: air - +27 ¬∞ C, water - +24 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  There is also a separate area with terrariums and aquariums.  However, those who have visited this part of the complex claim that the animals live in inappropriate conditions.  The cells are small, and the inhabitants themselves are thin and hungry.  Therefore, very sensitive children should not be taken there. </p>

    <h2>  Amount for entertainment </h2><p>  A lot of negative reviews leave regarding prices.  Tickets for performances during the holiday months are high.  There is a slight difference between the lateral and middle sectors.  In total, about 1000 people are accommodated in the hall. </p><p>  Other services and products are overpriced.  Guests are amazed at the high cost of a 5-minute swim with dolphins.  Almost twice as much you have to pay for water and food.  Also, a tidy sum will have to be paid for soft toys that will remind the child of the holiday. </p><p>  Recently, a dolphinarium has become very popular.  Yalta (the address of the complex is known to almost every vacationer) can be proud of this institution.  But many are not satisfied with the cost of entertainment. </p><h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  Unpleasantly amazing and the price of the photo.  You cannot enter the complex with your equipment.  However, the administration offers to use their services.  Of course, everyone wants to have a good photo from the ‚ÄúWater Area‚Äù as a keepsake.  But the cost of a professional is about 1000 rubles in a matter of minutes.  Also your entertainment can be recorded on video.  The material is given to the disc. </p>
