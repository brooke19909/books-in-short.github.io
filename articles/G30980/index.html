    <p>  As for the territory of Zlaten Rog 3 * (Golden Sands), it seemed to our compatriots small, but very well-groomed, clean and green.  Pleased with the presence of many colors.  There is also a small pool with a children's section.  If for some reason you do not want to go to the beach, then you can conveniently sit next to it on the sun terrace.  Tourists who have come to rest with their children also note the presence of a small playground on the territory of the hotel with a sandbox, a slide and a swing.  By the way, a lot of entertainment for kids can be found on the promenade.  The hotel also has Wi-Fi.  You can use it for a fee (about one and a half euros / hour). </p><h2>  Hotel Zlaten Rog 3 *: traveler reviews of the location </h2><p>  According to the comments of our compatriots, this hotel is in a quiet place, next to the park area.  The main infrastructure of Golden Sands can be reached in 10-15 minutes at a leisurely pace.  However, near the hotel there is a cafe, a supermarket and a bank branch.  By the way, experienced travelers are advised to change the currency here in banks, and not in private exchangers, since the latter offer a not very profitable rate.  The distance to the beach is about 300-400 meters.  You can reach the coast in 5-10 minutes.  However, on the way back you will have to climb the hill, so it can take about a quarter of an hour.  Please note that on the way to the beach you will need to cross a rather busy roadway.  For the convenience and safety of pedestrians there is an underpass.  A great advantage of the Zlaten Rog 3 * hotel, the reviews serve as proof of this, is its proximity to Varna, respectively, and to the airport.  So, the journey from the air harbor to the hotel will take you only about twenty minutes.  This fact was especially appreciated by travelers with children.  In addition, many vacationers often traveled to Varna.  This can be done either by bus (a stop is located next to the hotel) or by taxi.  By the way, tourists warn that you should be very careful if you want to use taxi services.  So, you must immediately negotiate with the driver the exact route and cost of the trip, otherwise you may be required to unreasonably large amount of money.  Also, some travelers mention a pleasant walk to the Aladzhi monastery.  The road to it runs through the park and takes about an hour. </p>

    <h2>  Beach Vacation Impressions </h2><p>  About 300-400 meters separate the city beaches of Golden Sands from the Zlaten Rog 3 * hotel.  Reviews of travelers who have been here come down to the fact that you can reach the coast in just 5-10 minutes by an unhurried step.  But the way back will take a little longer, because you have to climb the hill.  However, this fact practically did not bother anyone, since, according to tourists, it is always nice to take a little walk and burn calories gained at hearty lunches and dinners.  The beaches here are in municipal ownership, so the use of sunbeds and umbrellas is paid.  However, many of our compatriots did not rent chaise lounges, but conveniently settled on their mats or towels in unoccupied areas.  By the way, the beaches here are sandy and very clean.  The entrance to the water is gentle, so even children will be comfortable swimming.  If you want to try ice cream, refresh yourself with a drink or have a bite to eat, then there are a lot of cafes, restaurants and fast foods on the promenade.  In addition, there are shops, souvenir shops, a variety of attractions and much more.  Please note that experienced travelers are not advised to buy food and souvenirs on the waterfront.  This is due to the fact that as you move away from the shore the same things you can buy much cheaper.  So if you want to buy something, then, leaving the hotel, go towards the market.  According to our compatriots, the local shops have the most reasonable prices. </p>
