This settlement was formed in 1862 in the Crimean region.  In those ancient times, the village was part of the Taman department - an administrative unit in the Kuban region. </p><h2>  History of the formation of the settlement </h2><p>  In 1840, the Varenikov fortification was built to reinforce the Black Sea border line.  A military garrison was engaged in its construction.  After 1860, active settlement of these lands by people began.  As a result, the fortification gradually turned into a village.  Complete transformation into a settlement happened in 1862. </p><p>  Such a sharp transformation is associated with the reorganization of the neighboring village into a city.  People who did not want to become city dwellers moved to the territory of the Varenikovsky settlement. </p><p>  The inhabitants of the village were engaged in cattle breeding and cultivation of land.  The population has increased rapidly every year.  When the Great Patriotic War began in 1941, 5,000 people from the village went to the front. </p>
