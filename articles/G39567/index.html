    <p>  For guests who have a birthday during their stay, the staff gives a special compliment: a greeting card and a small cake are presented.  On Christmas holidays, the administration of the tourist complex provides a special entertainment program. </p><h2>  Hotel Coral Sea Water World.  Reviews </h2><p>  The rating of hotel service is inconsistent.  The hotel is rated 4 stars with a plus.  Reviews in the virtual network until the change of ownership in 2012 are very restrained.  Before the renovation, Coral Sea Water World 5 * ("Soral Sea Water Worldsoral", as it is also called in search engines) was mainly focused on the contingent of vacationers from English-speaking countries.  Therefore, the staff spoke only English or Arabic. </p><p>  In recent years, the level of service has increased significantly, although inferior to the service in hotels in the resorts of the United Arab Emirates.  Not all tourists are satisfied with the shallow coastal stretch of the sea, but for families, this is the most suitable place.  Tourists from Europe prefer to sunbathe in the hotel and swim in the pool.  Russians are usually located on the beach. </p><p>  If you have at least basic knowledge of English, then you can count on excellent service.  Especially noted a small percentage of compatriots and tourists from neighboring countries, which positively affects the relaxed atmosphere.  Despite the proximity of the airport, the sound of the aircraft is not audible.  Customers respond positively to the hotel‚Äôs home environment, although there have been some cases of discrimination against Russian speakers in favor of the British. </p>
