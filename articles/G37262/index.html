    <h2>  Most popular resorts </h2><p>  The most famous resort in the region is the city of Belokurikha - a health resort of Russian scale, which is widely known throughout the country.  Less well-known resort of regional importance is the city of Yarovoye with a healing lake.  Other resorts of the Altai Territory, photos of which can be seen in guidebooks, are less famous, but no less interesting and useful. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First of all, the lakes of the Romanovsky district should be called: Gorkoye, Molokovo, Guseletovo.  Mud lakes of the Zavyalovsky region are also very popular: Baklan, Zavyalovskoye, Mostovoe.  The reservoirs of the steppe zone, lakes Kulundinskoye, Buazhansor, Burlinskoye possess great potential.  All these places have great therapeutic and recreational potential, but so far their tourism infrastructure is less developed. </p>

    <h2>  Resort town Belokurikha </h2><p>  The real <span>sanatorium city, resort</span> Belokurikha (Altai Territory) has its history since the beginning of the 19th century.  But as a resort, the place began to develop in the 60s of the 19th century, when baths were first built here.  The curative properties of local sources were discovered by residents who drew attention to the fact that the cows that drink water from them are healthier and give more milk.  Aborigines themselves began to practice bathing in the springs, and this helped them get rid of many diseases. </p><p>  In 1866, the first bathhouse with 16 beds was built here.  By the end of the 19th century there was already a health resort, which hosted approximately 500 people a year.  Further development of the resort was hindered by strongly pronounced seasonality.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the development of territories began.  In the 1920s and 1930s, a health resort for state leaders was built here.  At this time, the healing properties of local sources are being studied.  It turns out that water contains a small amount of radon, as well as a lot of nitrogen, silicon and fluorine.  In the 60s, rapid construction began in Belokurikha, a number of large sanatoriums appeared here, the resort was gaining all-Union significance. </p><p>  Belokurikha becomes a year-round resort.  At the end of the 20th century, scientists proved that the air here contains twice as many useful aeroions than in Davos, Switzerland.  In post-perestroika times, the resort lost its appeal due to the fact that many tourists flocked abroad.  But today, former glory is returning to the health resort.  New sanatoriums are being built here, infrastructure is being developed. </p><p>  Today, good roads lead here, modern equipment has been installed in the sanatoriums.  The city has about 20 medical institutions with a total capacity of about 5 thousand beds.  The number of tourists is increasing every year, and this was the reason for the launch of the large-scale Belokurikha-2 project, within the framework of which new sanatoriums and ski resorts will be built.  Today, a magnificent road has already been laid to this place. </p>
