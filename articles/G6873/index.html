    <h2>  <span>Thermoelectric refrigerator</span> in the car from the cigarette lighter </h2><p>  Portable cooling systems come in many types.  The most suitable for use in a car is the so-called thermoelectric cooler, many consumers' feedback on such models is positive.  They are based on the Peltier effect, a thermoelectric phenomenon when heat is released or absorbed at the junction of two dissimilar conductors when an electric current passes through them.  Such a <span>car</span> cigarette lighter <span>refrigerator</span> is a plastic container or fabric bag.  Such a system can work not only in the car; some models can additionally be connected to a household fixed network.  Such an opportunity makes these devices universal.  They are environmentally friendly, noiseless and, unlike some types of portable refrigerators, resistant to shaking.  Ideal for Russian off-road. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Criteria for choosing a thermoelectric refrigerator: basic characteristics </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to determine the necessary volume of the model.  The thermoelectric <span>refrigerator in the car</span> from the cigarette lighter is mainly designed for no more than 50 liters.  For one family or a small company this is more than enough.  When choosing a car refrigerator from the cigarette lighter, it is better to check how you can fill the proposed volume.  It happens that with seemingly decent dimensions, even a two-liter bottle does not fit in the container - neither vertically nor horizontally. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator in the car from the cigarette lighter" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/983665.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Next, you should consider what functions are needed: only cooling or cooling and heating - there is also such a refrigerator from the cigarette lighter, the price for it, of course, is higher.  But this model is very convenient when after cooling drinks you can warm up lunch.  The heating level is 60-70 ¬∞ C and is controlled by a thermal relay.  Sometimes different cooling and heating modes are provided: economical and a mode with maximum load and speed. </p>

User reviews indicate that devices with such a case cool products faster and retain their temperature longer after turning off the power than fabric models.

    <p>  The degree of cooling by car refrigerators is a characteristic that is highly dependent on the ambient temperature.  Therefore, the description of the model states how many degrees below the temperature ‚Äúoverboard‚Äù this model can cool.  As a rule, this indicator varies between 10-20 ¬∞ C.  That is, if the ambient temperature is 25 Àö, then the products in the refrigerator will be cooled at best to 5 Àö. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of auto-refrigerators </h2><p>  One of the main disadvantages of car refrigerators is usually the fact that after turning off the power, the temperature in the container rises very quickly.  The question is how fast.  In different models, this parameter is expressed in different ways, but in the general case after 2 hours, if the refrigerator is disconnected from the power supply, the temperature inside the container will be only 5-7 ¬∞ C lower than the temperature outside, and this fact must be taken into account.  But if the model supports the power supply method from a regular household network and upon arrival there is an opportunity to connect a refrigerator to it, there will be no problems at all. </p><p>  Since cooling in such designs takes place rather slowly, before putting food into the car refrigerator from the cigarette lighter, it will not be superfluous to cool them.  You can use an additional <span>cold battery</span> with saline inside. </p><h2>  Technical characteristics of thermoelectric refrigerators </h2><p>  The strength of the current consumed by the devices lies in the range from 4.5 to 8.5 A, which will not cause an overload of the car cigarette lighter.  Power can be supplied from a 12 V network and, in some models, from a 220 V network. A working element in thermoelectric refrigerators can be placed either on the lid or on one of the walls.  It must be remembered that it is impossible to block the flow of air to it. </p><p>  Compartments for the power cord are most often arranged in covers.  You should pay attention to the length of the cord, it depends on whether it will be possible to install a refrigerator in the back seat of the car without using an extension cord.  To change the cooling mode to heating, and vice versa, you need to change the polarity when connecting the power cord.  <span>You can install refrigerators</span> most often with the lid up, but some models allow vertical installation, in which case the lid becomes a door. </p><h2>  Design features of refrigerators: additional functions </h2><p>  In addition to the fact that the walls of the container can be plastic or fabric, the refrigerator handle has some design features.  It can be reclining and additionally be a lock that does not allow opening the lid when carrying.  Also, the functions of the handles sometimes perform grooves on both sides of the case, in which case there is a snap or slide lock on the case.  The lid is always equipped with a seal, so it most often opens very tightly and in some models it is composite - it is convenient when you need to get something small - you do not need to open the entire camera, letting in warm air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car cigarette lighter reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/983663.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The bottom is provided with a closing opening for condensate drainage.  Sometimes there are even wheels for transportation, in this case a long handle is also provided. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  There are many manufacturers of automotive refrigerators on the market.  Here are just a few of them: Campingaz, Ezetil, Koolatron, Mystery, Waeco, Mobicool, Indel B. Moreover, the price range for thermoelectric refrigerators is without exaggeration the widest: literally from 3,000 to 30,000 rubles, depending on the volume, functions and country manufacturer. </p><p>  When choosing a car refrigerator from a cigarette lighter, reviews of other drivers about the model you need to buy should be carefully studied so as not to be disappointed in the purchase. </p>
