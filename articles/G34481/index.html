For a long time they have been using this chrysalis stuffed with various aromatic medicinal herbs to this day for the prevention of various diseases and aromatherapy. </p><p>  It is very simple to create a herbal grass-catcher doll, and we will be happy to tell you how to do it at home. </p><h2>  Herbalist - the ancient guardian of health </h2><p>  The history of the herbal capsule amulets originates in times far from modern technologies and knowledge of medicine.  Despite the fact that medicine in those days was not in the best condition, our ancestors were famous for their incredible strength, pep, and health.  From their glorious times to our modern ones, the ability to craft interesting rag dolls was transferred that saved the owner from negative energy, protected from colds, weaknesses and other diseases.  The beregin from herbs strengthened the health of those living in the house, supported the immune system, strength of mind, created a pleasant aroma in the house, playing the role of a flavoring.  It was called a herbal capsule. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lush doll with herbs" class="if uuid-3154526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3154526.jpg"></div><h2>  Herbalist appointment </h2><p>  This simple but significant amulet was an indispensable part in every house of those times.  They stuffed it with special compositions of herbs, which protected from ailments, strengthened the immune system.  When someone in the house was sick, the doll was laid at the head of the bed on which the person was lying.  People believed that the pill helped to heal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The little rag doll was given to the children to play with her.  The herbal grass-egg doll was not only an interesting toy for children, but also had a pleasant aroma, cleaned the air, soothed, lured good, good dreams and a good dream.  People believed that thanks to these dolls, children grew up healthy and strong. </p><p>  The ancestors attached great importance to the herbal capsule, it was supposed to protect the house from evil forces, improve the mood in the house, keeping the family strong and friendly, and set its pleasant aroma to good deeds and good thoughts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cultura.kh.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Herbal Cube" class="if uuid-3154543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3154543.jpg"></div><h2>  Variations of pupae </h2><p>  The dolls-amulets of the herbal capsule are full of different herbs and have different purposes.  Previously, the housewives made several egg capsules for the house, and each had its own special purpose and place in the dwelling.  If you want to create a doll for yourself, choose which one you need according to the purpose, or make a few. </p><p>  One small egg was placed or hung from the crib of a small child.  While the baby was sleeping, the herbalist guarded his sleep, his health.  The herbalist was placed at the bedside of adults, she protected their health, not allowing the ailments to walk around the house, she protected the inhabitants from diseases, from evil spirits.  In the old days, it was believed that properly collected and enchanted herbs protect residents from demons and protect sleep. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another herbal capsule was filled with aromatic herbs.  From the finished dolls came a marvelous, pleasant, pacifying aroma.  They also helped the household to sleep soundly, to have pleasant dreams.  The finished doll was placed under the pillows, they were stuffed with medicinal herbs (mint, lavender, thyme, oregano and motherwort).  A set of such herbs calmed, helped in the fight against insomnia, averted nightmares.  The next morning, our ancestors woke up rested, full of strength, energy, in a good mood. </p><p>  The third chrysalis was placed in the kitchen.  She was stuffed with herbs, causing a stormy appetite.  Dill, dandelion, and root were suitable for this.  In addition, this set of herbs cleans the air, eliminates unpleasant odors, emphasizes homeliness. </p><p>  The fourth doll, a herbalist-pill, was placed in a cellar or settled in a barn.  She served as a disinfectant.  It was stuffed with various strongly odorous herbs that scared away pests.  In particular, rodents, which during the hungry season with pleasure made their way into the cellar, eating supplies.  The composition of such a pupa included wormwood, mint, tansy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Herbs for amulets" class="if uuid-3154559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3154559.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a herbal capsule do it yourself? </h2><p>  There has long been a traditional way of creating this special amulet with your own hands.  But each hostess still makes such a doll in her own way, connecting imagination and giving the product a certain uniqueness.  Someone embroidered various patterns, flowers on doll clothes.  Someone made of twine or thread braids, weaved ribbons.  Someone tied the head of the chrysalis with a handkerchief, put on her a beautiful painted apron.  They hung necklaces from rowan berries on the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Making a herbal capsule is very simple; not much material is needed for it.  The main component of the chrysalis is herbs, aromatic, medicinal, properly collected and dried. </p><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolls of the herbalist workshop" class="if uuid-3154523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3154523.jpg"></div><h2>  Picking herbs </h2><p>  If before, to make a herbal capsule, you had to collect all the necessary herbs yourself, now you can buy them in a pharmacy or in the market from grandmothers.  Although, of course, it is much nicer when the plants are prepared with their own hands, just like the mistresses did in the old days. </p><p>  Herbs need to be collected correctly, especially for a miraculous amulet.  Wake up on a warm summer morning.  Surely on a sunny day, with a smile and a great mood.  Put on comfortable, non-marking clothes and leave the house.  Traditionally, collecting herbs was a fun, enjoyable company, so take your friends with you if you wish. </p><p>  For different purposes, you will need different herbs: </p><ul><li>  for a quiet sleep - motherwort, chamomile, oregano, lemon balm, hops; </li><li>  from colds - sage, wormwood, needles, St. John's wort, pine cones; </li><li>  for comfort - garlic seeds, juniper, thyme; </li><li>  for the bedroom - mint, raspberries, currant or cherry twigs; </li><li>  for appetite - dill, parsley, basil, celery, garlic. </li></ul><p>  Gather the right herbs carefully, carefully.  Fold in a bag, and tie at home in bunches and dry in the sun.  From the collected herbs, you can not only brew tasty gulls, but also create a charm doll. </p><h2>  Material for creating a chrysalis </h2><p>  To create a doll, herbal capsules need shreds of natural fibers.  Preferably cotton, linen.  The brighter the fabric, the better.  Craftswomen are of the opinion that a talisman has more power if made of cloth cut from old things of the hostess.  The finished amulet will be saturated with the energy of the owner and mistress of the house. </p><p>  Let's see what we may need to create our own herbal capsules: </p><ul><li>  To create a doll‚Äôs head, a patch of square shape is needed, with a side of about 20-22 cm, for the head it is advisable to use a fabric of white color, soft pink, light cream - light tones, the gentle tone of the face represents a clear mind, clear thoughts of a talisman and mistress of the house; </li><li>  for the pupa‚Äôs chest, two square segments of 12 cm and two lumps of cotton wool; </li><li>  for a sundress, take the material brighter and more elegant, a shred a little more than for the head, 2-3 cm; </li><li>  if desired, take a small piece of bright fabric to create an apron; </li><li>  two squares, the same as on the chest, for the pouches, in which subsequently you need to fold the collected herbs; </li><li>  to fill the voids of the pupa, take a rag: old cloth, cotton; </li><li>  to decorate the dolls, take colored ribbons, braid, lace and other decorative elements; </li><li>  take a few pieces of bright strong thread. <div class="photo" data-original="belinskogo.kh.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Herbalist Kubyshka" class="if uuid-3154547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3154547.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  The process of creating a chrysalis </h2><p>  The creation of the herbal capsule begins with the head.  For filling, you can use cotton wool, rags.  The head should be proportional to the body.  Take a white piece of fabric for the head, put cotton inside, twist and fix with a thread.  The head should be flat, without wrinkles.  Wrap it with red thread. </p><p>  Next, we make hands.  Take the corner of the fabric, fold it inward a little and wind it with thread.  Do the same with the second one so that you get two pens. </p><p>  Form a waist under them.  Thread the doll under the handles. </p><p>  Next is the chest.  From pieces of colored fabric, as well as the head, make two packed balls.  Secure with thread.  It is advisable to make bigger breasts - this is a symbol of fertility and fertility. </p><p>  Thread fluffy chest to the body of the doll. </p><p>  Take prepared herbs and shreds of cloth for pouches.  Put the plants in the middle, lay the remaining space with cotton.  Tie the bags together with the handles.  Put the remaining herbs in a large flap of body tissue.  Connect them to the body, tightly tied with strings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hand-made.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a little egg do-it-yourself" class="if uuid-3154537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3154537.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoration </h2><p>  The doll is ready, and it can be decorated.  For example, tie a scarf of bright fabric to her, put braids of threads, ribbons, twine under it. </p><p>  You can put on a beregin in a dress sewn separately or just tie an apron.  Take a piece of fabric, attach it to the waist, tie it with tape or thick thread.  Cross the ends crosswise at the back and tie a bow. </p><p>  Decorate the doll as you wish, connecting fantasy. </p><p>  After the herbalist is ready, it must be activated as a talisman, the shore of home comfort. </p><h2>  The main rule! </h2><p>  In the process of creating a talisman, namely the body, you can not pierce the product with a needle, cut with scissors.  Prepare in advance, cut pieces of fabric, but do not cut anything on the doll.  Do not use scissors, knitting needles, pins and needles to create.  To fasten parts to each other, grab tapes and threads. </p><p>  You can use scissors and needles when creating clothes for the doll.  But sew sundresses, scarves and aprons separately. </p><p>  It is necessary to create a talisman with a good mood, putting all the warmth, love, care into the work.  Think about your family, about the person for whom you make a doll. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY herbalist at home" class="if uuid-3154538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3154538.jpg"></div><h2>  Charm Activation </h2><p>  When the chrysalis is ready, it is necessary to carry out a ritual with it and talk with a talisman.  Say hello to the herbal capsule.  Tell her everything you want from her.  Speak politely, affectionately, respectfully, call your pet and beauty.  Be sure to thank her for being in your home now. </p><p>  If you made a doll for someone, then also say hello to her, tell who you will take her to, what is required of her, ask for longevity and prosperity to future owners. </p><p>  Indicate that the recipients also greet the doll, thank them for their help. </p><p>  An emotional conversation with a talisman activates her, sets her up for the right, positive mood.  After that, the chrysalis can be placed in its rightful place.  Be sure to clean it there, remove dust, you can cover the shelf with a napkin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.mehrnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collecting Herbs for Eggs" class="if uuid-3154557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3154557.jpg"></div><h2>  Terms of Use </h2><p>  There are some rules in the use of rag amulets full of fragrant herbs.  If your baby doll is caking a little and has lost its former aroma, carefully remember the bags so that the herbs give out more essential oils.  This can be done daily before bedtime, but be careful.  If handled carelessly, dry herbs can turn into dust. </p><p>  Rag weed can serve its mistress for a long time.  Properly harvested and dried plants do not deteriorate and do not lose their aromatic and medicinal properties for a long time.  In addition, you can optionally change herbs in bags. </p><p>  The same goes for the chrysalis outfit.  You can also change aprons, dresses, scarves, hair using the technique described above.  Just do not forget: dolls can not be cut and pricked, you can not use sewing needles and scissors in the process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hand-made.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY herbalist" class="if uuid-3154540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3154540.jpg"></div><p>  That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs so easy to create a do-it-yourself herbalist doll doll.  What a pleasant aroma comes from her!  Hide various herbs in her bags, soak her with natural essential oils.  Be attentive to your little talisman. </p><p>  The doll-herbalist-capsule is in demand not only as a charm, but also as an interesting element of decor, and an assistant in aromatherapy.  A cocktail of pleasant, rich aromas can really be a great soothing.  Lavender, mint, needles positively affect the mood.  Natural aromas, hand-picked herbs are really for your household good prevention, protection against colds in the cold season. </p>
