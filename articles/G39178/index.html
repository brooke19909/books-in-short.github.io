How to get from Bali?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Gili Islands (Indonesia) are familiar to all beach lovers <span>in Bali.</span>  Three tiny pieces of land, surrounded on all sides by the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean, look very attractive from a bird's eye view.  Well, having met with Trawangan, Meno and Air, I want to stay here forever.  Many call Bali a <span>paradise island.</span>  Yes, in many ways he is good and even wonderful.  Bali is rich in historical and natural attractions.  But if you are interested in the beaches and the clear <span>turquoise sea,</span> then it is better not to find the Gili Islands that are part of the Western Small Sunda Archipelago.  They are located just thirty-five kilometers from the eastern cape of Bali.  But from the air you can‚Äôt get to Gili.  On tiny islands there is no place for the construction of an airport.  The only way is by sea.  This article will tell you about the specifics of Trawangan, Air and Meno.  We will also show you how to get to the islets and where to rent a house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gili islands" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1247833.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bounty embodied advertisement </h2><p>  Our ideas of "heavenly enjoyment" are often based on the video seen on the chocolate bar.  Warm white sand, as fine as icing sugar;  calm gentle sea, purity and color resembling turquoise, and on the horizon - sapphire;  slender palm trees leaning toward the water itself ... That is why many tourists go to Bali.  And they are surprised to learn that everything is a little wrong on the volcanic island.  And in order to live in advertising for the Bounty coconut bar, you need to go a little east - to the Gili Islands.  Photos of Trawangan, Air and Meno do not lie.  All three islands are different, have their own specifics.  But they all have gorgeous beaches.  Just like in the Bounty ad.  Curious tourists who do not imagine holidays without informative excursions, Gili will not suit.  But for those who crave passive relaxation on the beach, they are just right.  Active divers and snorkelling enthusiasts will also not be disappointed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gili islands photo" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1248079.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The specifics of the Gili Islands </h2><p>  Trawangan is the largest of the trinity.  The islands of Gili Air and Meno are much smaller.  Accordingly, if you want to alternate beach vacations during the day with fun in the evening, you are on Trawangan.  You cannot call this island big, except in comparison with two neighboring tiny pieces of land.  But on Trawangan there is a sufficient selection of hotels for every taste and fullness of a credit card, cafes, restaurants and even night clubs.  There is even a food market.  And if you want to renounce civilization and feel like some sort of Robinson Crusoe on the edge of the earth, then you can go to the islands of Gili Meno and Air.  Fortunately, they are only a kilometer from Trawangan.  From this island you can see the mountainous Lombok.  And from the opposite shore you can admire Bali.  Rather, the island itself is hidden behind the horizon, but the towering peak of the Batur volcano is visible in the sky.  There are few hotels on Air, but on Meno there are even fewer hotels, so you need to book a hotel there in advance. </p><h2>  Gili (islands): how to get there.  The fastest and most expensive option </h2><p>  In fact, Gili is not very far from the island of Lombok.  And he, respectively, is located very close to Bali.  You can get to the "Bounty Islands" only by sea.  But there are options.  The ticket price directly affects the time spent on the journey.  The more you pay, the faster and with better comfort you will reach the island of Gili you need.  The most expensive option is a private transfer.  You will be taken from Bali, from the point that you indicate, taken by car to the Padang Bay pier, boarded a high-speed glider and delivered to the desired island.  The issue price is one hundred or more US dollars per passenger.  But you will be at the place an hour or eighty minutes after leaving the hotel in Bali. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gili islands how to get" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1247843.jpg" width="600"></div>

How to get from Bali to Trawangan?  To do this, you need to drive to Padang Bay Marina on your own.  There are other options.  You can pay at a tour desk in Bali for a trip to Gili.  It will cost a little more, but then you will be picked up from the hotel (if you are relaxing in Nusa Dua) ‚Äã‚Äãor from McDonald's in Jimbaran.  Tickets can be bought in Kut or directly at the box office.  Speedboats <span>(speedboats)</span> depart from Bali at nine in the morning, at noon and at three in the afternoon.  What is encouraging - they give a return ticket with an open date.  This will allow you to leave Gili at any time: earlier than planned, if you are not lucky with the weather;  later - if you really enjoy your stay on the "paradise island."  Speedboat overcomes a distance of thirty-five kilometers per hour with a little.  First, the boat calls on Trawangan, then on Meno (a kilometer from the larger island) and lastly on Air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gili islands reviews" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1247842.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cheapest option </h2><p>  There are also public ferries to the Gili Islands.  "Bali - Lombok" leaves from the same pier Padang Bay.  This ferry runs regularly, but slowly.  Please note that public transport for local does not provide air conditioning and any amenities (except for the toilet).  In Lombok, you should transfer to another ferry, to Gili Trawangan.  Boats on smaller islands - Meno and Air - go very rarely.  They are ordinary wooden motorboats with additional boards on the sides for stability.  But this whole day trip will leave a lot of impressions.  A plus of this option is the opportunity to see Lombok.  Many tourists traveling in Indonesia are even advised to stay on this island for a night or two.  Another advantage is the low price.  Two tickets on the Bali-Lombok-Gili public ferry will cost one passenger thirty thousand rupees (or twenty US dollars). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gili bali islands" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1247850.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get around </h2><p>  To keep the Gili Islands environmentally friendly, local authorities banned all kinds of motorized modes of transport.  So if you travel with a scooter, you will have to leave it in a paid parking lot in Bali or Lombok.  You definitely will not be put on a ferry or boat to Gili with him.  But don't be discouraged.  Even the largest of the Gili islands, Trawangan, is two and a half kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide.  You can get around it around the perimeter in an hour with a little.  In a good hotel you can always rent bicycles, since the flat terrain of the islands does not turn pedaling into hard labor.  Another type of local transport is tuk-tuks pulled by ponies.  Rather, this is another attraction for tourists than a way to travel.  Moreover, tuk-tuks are quite an expensive pleasure.  A trip in a carriage will cost eighty thousand rupees.  Boats are the most popular form of transport in Gili.  You can ride on a regular wooden junk.  For those who are panicky afraid to dive, there are boats with a glass bottom.  And between the three islands of Gili from morning to evening scurry carriers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gili islands how to get from bali" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1247876.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  All Gili islands have their own specifics.  Trawangan is considered the most expensive.  But this is only at first glance.  Luxury hotels, the night of which costs from a hundred dollars, are on the first line of the north and east coasts.  But already across the road (especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa local school), a lot of hotels are simpler.  Even backpackers can rent housing here.  A room in a guesthouse will cost ten dollars a night.  Gili Air is cheaper.  But there are also chic hotels, although many tourists prefer to stay in apartments with a kitchen.  Prices for a room in a guesthouse start from five dollars per night.  In the center of the island are only a mosque and government agencies.  All hotels, even the cheapest, are located on the first line.  Gili Meno is also called the island of the newlyweds.  There are few hotels here, they need to be booked in advance.  Also, do not compare Meno with the party Trawangan.  To feel happy in this tropical Eden, you need to have Eve (or Adam) nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gili bali islands reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1248064.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Things to do in Gili </h2><p>  According to reviews, the main pastime of tourists is languid lying on the beach.  And when the sun tends to the horizon, the audience goes to the west coast, sits comfortably in deck chairs or right on the cooling sand with a bottle of some drink and indulges in the contemplation of sunsets.  Sunset - a truly spectacular sight.  For the sake of sunsets alone, it‚Äôs worth coming to the Gili Islands.  Reviews also compare the local waters with the Egyptian Ras Mohammed.  The inhabitants of coral reefs are not only colorful fish, but also stingrays, giant manta rays, turtles and sharks.  Few people know, but there are good bays for surfers on Trawangan and Air.  They are located on the southern extremities of these islets.  There are schools in the diving aria where they teach scuba diving.  They even give diplomas on Trawangan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gili islands indonesia" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1248068.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gili Islands (Bali): reviews </h2><p>  All tourists say that several categories of vacationers feel great here: </p><ul><li>  newlyweds or lovers </li><li>  very lazy people for whom rest is languid lying on the beach, </li><li>  divers and surfers, </li><li>  very young children, for whom the main attraction is the construction of sand castles. </li></ul><p>  Gili do not pamper tourists with excursions.  The only thing that tour operators can offer you is a trip on a glass bottom boat.  The tour lasts about three hours and costs a thousand rupees per person.  On the way, the boat makes several stops among the reefs, and those who want to dive, and not just see, can plunge into the gentle waters of the Indian Ocean. </p>
