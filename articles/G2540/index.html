    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  I must say that the company Oriel has never been distinguished by any unusual or especially rich package.  It is logical to assume that the model got everything to a minimum.  According to customer reviews, there is nothing superfluous. </p><p>  In the kit you can find: a control panel, batteries for it and Oriel 963 operating instructions. If you need a cable to connect the device to a TV, you will have to purchase it separately.  Please note that not all cables are suitable for certain models.  Many owners complain about this.  Based on the reviews about the Oriel 963, I must say that it is worth thinking several times before purchasing the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oriel 963 instruction manual" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1936620.jpg" width="600"></div>

Has a rectangular shape, perforated base, made of metal.  In addition, there is a top cover, and the front panel is made of plastic.  It should be noted a slight difference between this model - the console uses a power supply that is built into the case.  Thanks to this, it is easier to use, connect and maintain. </p><h2>  Back and front panels </h2><p>  Considering the model, the Oriel 963 has a digital display.  It received excellent viewing angles, so even in the presence of bright sunlight, the text remains readable.  This is often written by consumers who bought the device.  The clock may appear on the display if the unit is in standby mode.  At the same time, the channel number will be indicated.  On the left side is a button for cyclic switching of channels.  There is also a power button and an LED indicator of work.  In standby mode, the latter does not turn off, but lights up in red.  In operating mode, it glows green. </p><p>  On the right is the port for connecting USB.  It is useful to those who plan to work with a computer or other gadgets.  The owner‚Äôs reviews said that this device works perfectly with all possible devices. </p><p>  On the back panel you can find a huge set of ports for different types of gadgets: </p><ul><li>  antenna input (RF IN); </li><li>  pass-through antenna output (RF OUT); </li><li>  stereo audio output (L: R); </li><li>  digital coaxial audio output (COAXIAL); </li><li>  composite video output (CVBS); </li><li>  SCART analog audio / video output (TV); </li><li>  HDMI digital audio / video output. </li></ul>

That is why thanks are filled with reviews about Oriel 963. Problems arise quite rarely.  The device runs on the chipset model Ali M3812.  It is often used in consoles of this type, so I could prove myself on the good side.  Together with this process, a device from Sony is used.  It allows you to tune the tuner and has a demodulator. </p><p>  Channels can be switched at a prohibitive rate.  Even a weak signal will be received perfectly without glitches and interference.  And these are only one of the most pleasant advantages of this device.  The console also supports T2 technology, which allows you to work with more advanced features. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Before you start working with this device, you must connect the antenna.  In order to receive a stable digital-type broadcast signal, you will need a conventional <span>UHF antenna.</span>  If this device is not, but there is a transmitter, then you can use a small piece of wire or wire instead.  Consumers say this sometimes works.  But still, the manufacturer recommends using high-quality parts to get the most out of watching TV.  It‚Äôs better to buy an antenna rather than reinvent the wheel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oriel 963 review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1936622.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Antenna use </h2><p>  In order to have a stable, high-quality and reliable signal, while being far enough from the transmitter, it is necessary to use an external antenna.  It is desirable that she was a model of DVB-T2.  Some characteristics of the Oriel 963 are described above. They will help you choose the best components for this console. </p><p>  In the reviews you can read that sometimes it is best to raise the device to a height - so the signal becomes in some cases only better.  If the transmitter is very far away, you will have to use a special antenna, which has an additional amplifier. </p><p>  If the consumer uses an all-wave detail, then he will be able to watch not only standard analog channels, but also digital ones.  This is achieved by combining the RF OUT connector with an optional antenna cable.  It should be noted that the antenna will show maximum results only if a person uses the receiver model Oriel 963. Due to the fact that the device has a huge number of built-in ports on the rear panel, you can connect additional devices.  The main thing when turning on the TV channels is to remember to activate the signal supply through the receiver itself. </p>

    <h2>  Channels and their switching </h2><p>  After the buyer clicks, having completed all the settings, the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button, he automatically activates the scan of all digital channels that are available.  It should be noted that the search is carried out in two standards.  The procedure is as quick as possible.  Channels can be sorted without problems.  After scanning, the channels are immediately available for viewing, the receiver switches to the corresponding mode.  It includes the one that was placed by the program at number 1. In the reviews you can find out information that there is an opportunity to learn more about the broadcast shown in real time or about any other that has already been or will be.  In addition, data is available on the switched channel, the power of the received signal and its quality.  The owner also has a bunch of additional features. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oriel 963 tuning" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1936624.jpg"></div>
