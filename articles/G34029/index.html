Crete?  If you are nevertheless lucky enough to go there on vacation or visit there for some other reason, we recommend that you stay at the wonderful Petrosana Hotel Apartments 3 * (Ayia Napa).  In the article we will consider the advantages and disadvantages of living here, as well as find out the opinion about the hotel of its former guests. </p><h2>  Cyprus for a Russian person (instead of joining) </h2><p>  Once upon a time there lived gods on the island - relatives of the ‚Äúfoam-born‚Äù Aphrodite (at least, the Greeks say).  Apparently, they were helpless collectors and hunters, who were easily replaced by the ancestors of the Hellenes in the 11th century.  BC  e.  Even during the Turkish expansion, the descendants of Aristotle who forever registered here forever lost to the invaders no more than 38% of the territory (in the north).  In the 20th century, another 2% of zemlitsa had to be given to the British under military bases.  Finally, in the 90s, the Greek republic was occupied by ... Russian dollars.  The mansions of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù (now, rather, old) Russians are evenly scattered throughout the Greek part of the island.  The life of these people, saturated with sunny bliss and excursions to the Parthenon, was the first advertisement of a new tourist destination (now it is the 2nd most popular in the Russian Federation).  Cyprus for the Russian tourist is everything: fur coats, jewelry, arrogant Greek wit in restaurants, grottoes in a thousand deserted islands and, of course, hotel service.  According to reviews of knowledgeable people, at Petrosana Hotel Apartments it is at a special height. </p>

    <h2>  Ayia Napa - Grottoes and the Blessed Grove filled with club music </h2><p>  This wonderful hotel <span>Petrosana Hotel 3 *</span> is located in the east of the island - in the city, whose name translates as "The Blessed Grove".  Before the fishing village turned into a resort, she inherited the name from an Orthodox monastery located nearby.  He is now the main attraction of this place.  In the second turn, visitors visit the rocky caves of Makronisos, in the third - a picturesque protected forest on Cape Greko (apparently, it was once called the Blessed Grove). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is Petrosana Apartments? </h2><p>  A fashionable shelter is built in the northern part of a noisy village - on Gianni Ritsou Street (Building 7).  This is a hotel quarter surrounded by bars and souvenir supermarkets.  The sea is not more than a kilometer from here, and Larnaca Airport is 35 km away. </p><p>  Petrosana Hotel 3 * Apartments ("Petrosana Hotel Apartments") is more like a villa of a large oligarch - a building built of square modules - with huge arches-balconies.  The higher the level, the fewer they are.  In total there are 3 floors.  Around there are several bizarre outdoor pools (they are found in the courtyard and are equipped with sun loungers and <span>parasols, the</span> round is intended for children).  One of the ‚Äúblocks‚Äù - the buildings serves as a receptacle for the restaurant where Wai-Fai and the musicians live (in the evening they play something on guitars). </p>

    <h2>  Beaches in Ayia Napa: It's indecent to miss here </h2><p>  As vacationers note in their reviews, they usually meet sunrise and sunset on the main local beach - Nissi Beach.  "Tear-off" parties start in 4 nightclubs long before dark ... </p><p>  Children are usually taken to the water park (the fun kingdom of Greek attractions and Russian animators) and ride on Rasputin, Josephine and Hercules (here they are just donkeys). </p><p>  So the <span>Petrosana Hotel 3 *</span> hotel is <span>suitable for a quiet family holiday, and for noisy, cheerful youth.</span>  <span>Here everyone will find something to their liking.</span>  <span>This is confirmed by numerous reviews of tourists.</span> </p><p>  As for the weather - even in January, the daytime temperature does not fall below +18 ¬∞ C.  In the summer, the water on this beach literally boils.  Nissi Beach and the rest of the coast are environmentally friendly (as the blue flags in the sand proudly testify to). </p>
