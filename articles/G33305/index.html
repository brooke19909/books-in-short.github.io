    <p>  The battle of Stalingrad to a large extent influenced the radical change during the <span>Great Patriotic War.</span>  It began on July 17, 1942, and lasted until the second of February, one thousand nine hundred and forty-three.  All military processes took place inside the city.  The defensive movement was led by the famous generals V.I. Chuikov, A.I. Rodimtsev.  The German command needed to take control of Stalingrad as soon as possible.  Thanks to his capture, the Volga transport artery was automatically cut, which served as the only way to deliver bread and oil products for that difficult time. </p><p>  The plan that turned the tide of military events </p><p>  Based on the Soviet plan under the secret name ‚ÄúUranus‚Äù, in November nineteen forty-two, the Red Army carried out a turning point in the battle - they went on the offensive and surrounded the German group several days later, this action was carried out under the direct command of General F. von Paulus. </p><p>  Beginning in November 1942 and ending in December 1943, according to the strategic initiative, which was firmly able to gain a foothold in the hands of the Soviet leadership, the Red Army gradually shifted from defense to ideally thought out strategic offensives.  It is for this reason that this period of the war was given the name ‚Äúradical change‚Äù. </p><p>  The defeat of the fascist group </p><p>  As a result of encirclement near Stalingrad, a huge army of the Nazis consisting of three hundred thirty thousand people was captured.  Based on the <span>strategic plan</span> under the secret name "Ring", the Soviet troops began the defeat of the fascist group, its premature division into southern and northern parts.  The first capitulated south, and eventually the north. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The significance of the Battle of Stalingrad is that: </p><p>  1) a radical change in the <span>Great Patriotic War</span> occurred precisely in this bloody battle; <br>  2) the anti-fascist countries of Europe intensified the struggle against the fascists; <br>  3) there was an aggravation of foreign policy relations between Germany and its immediate military allies. </p><p>  Red Army is eager for battle again </p><p>  December 1942 was marked by the beginning of the Red Army's offensive in the Caucasus.  In January 1943, the Soviet army partially broke through the blockade, and this, in its turn, was also a radical turning point in the war.  The described battle on the Kursk Bulge was planned by representatives of the German command for the winter of 1943. Based on the Citadel plan, the Nazis planned to encircle and destroy the troops of the Voronezh and Central Fronts, which were concentrated directly on the Kursk ledge. </p><p>  The Soviet command predicted the course of events of the upcoming operations, as a result of which forces were concentrated for conducting offensives.  The battle on the <span>Kursk Bulge</span> fell on July 1943, its duration was about two months.  The course of this battle can be divided into two main periods: the first is marked by a defensive battle, the second by counterattacks. </p><p>  And a great holiday has come on our street </p><p>  In 1943, a large-scale battle took place near Prokhorovka, and on August 5 the following cities were liberated: Oryol and Belgorod.  Thanks to this event, for the first time in the entire course of the war a festive salute was given.  On the twenty-third of August, the battle ended, which was marked by the <span>liberation of Kharkov.</span>  The North Caucasus, Rostov, Voronezh, Oryol, Kursk region were also liberated. </p><p>  In December 1943, the capital of Ukraine was liberated, and the enemy moved far away from the vicinity of the city.  These great events marked a radical change in the course of the war. </p>
