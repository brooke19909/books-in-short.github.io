Among them, the Sochi Park amusement park stands out, which will be interesting to both children and adults, especially since getting to it is very simple. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The project of a huge entertainment complex based on Russian folk tales and scientific achievements was conceived back in 2011.  After making a decision on the construction, its implementation began.  An entertainment center was created in the Imereti lowland of the Adler region.  Sochi Park was built specifically on the territory of the <span>Olympic Park</span> near the sea. </p><p>  The park opened on June 1, 2014, on <span>Children's Day.</span>  However, during the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sochi, one could also visit it, which made more than 140 thousand people.  Then the park worked only in test mode. </p>

    <p>  There is an ice rink near the entertainment center (in Sochi Olympic Park), so they did not begin to build it nearby.  But they plan to build a dolphinarium, and recognized stars from the current Sochi dolphinarium will be performing there.  Its opening should take place in the summer of 2015.  Also, a lot of various sculptures dedicated to fairy tales, including green ones, were built here, and characters from children's books are walking along the streets. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The schedule of Sochi Park is stable: every day it is open for visitors from 11 to 22 hours.  It works without days off all year round. </p><h2>  Attractions for adults </h2><p>  The amusement park "Sochi Park" is unique in every way.  So, there are 3 attractions for adults who have no analogues in Russia!  These attractions are available for adults and children from 12 years old, but not even every adult will decide to ride them. </p><p>  1. The Firebird.  Feel on yourself all the charms of free fall from a height of 65 meters!  You will definitely have long-lasting memories of such a rise and fall. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Basically, all visitors, with or without children, are completely delighted after the visit.  In particular, there are many benches in the park and even padded stools, so it is simply impossible to get tired very much there.  Also, visitors found a huge plus in the fact that you can, for example, come to the park in the morning, then leave it for a nap and go back on the same tickets. </p><p>  The only drawback that visitors to the park note is the high cost of food and the price of tickets, but the issue of food can be easily resolved - just grab something edible with you or take a walk and look for cheaper cafes outside the complex. </p><p>  As visitors note, sometimes queues for attractions are formed, but this is quite normal for such a complex. </p><p>  Many talk about the incompleteness of work, because they were in 2014, when not all parts of the park were still functioning.  Now, when everything works, it's a pleasure to go there! </p>
