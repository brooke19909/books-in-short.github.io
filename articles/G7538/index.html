History of quilling technology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Quilling is a very popular type of needlework.  Using this technique, you can make a huge number of postcards, paintings, caskets and other interesting gizmos.  The history of the creation of quilling goes back in time.  And though much has changed in this technique, but refinement and charm remain, not inferior to those that were characteristic of products of bygone centuries. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of quilling" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/903755.jpg" width="468"></div></h2><h2>  What is quilling </h2><p>  The history of quilling is very interesting and multifaceted.  The word itself has English roots and means ‚Äúbird feather‚Äù in translation.  And this is no coincidence.  The ‚Äúbricks‚Äù that are made of paper using this technique are similar in shape to <span>bird feathers.</span>  It is also known that medieval monks, who were among the first to create quilling figures, twisted strips of paper using a bird's feather. </p><p>  The name of this art is far from one.  Quilling is also called paper rolling. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of quilling" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/903668.jpg" width="375"></div></h2><h2>  The history of quilling: the path to Europe </h2><p>  Filigree paper processing was known in ancient Egypt, whose inhabitants used papyrus to make figures.  In the XVI century, this art appeared in Europe.  In particular, French and Italian monks using <span>quilling techniques</span> made small crafts, and then they decorated and framed the icons.  This was a cheap alternative to gold and silver filigree.  Also, this technique was used in the creation of medallions and pendants.  Perhaps it was the strong influence of the church that influenced the fact that the history of quilling in these countries was associated more with cultural events than with a hobby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

At that time, the cost of paper, especially color and high quality, was very high, so this type of needlework was a subject of interest to ladies only from the upper layers of society.

    <p>  Later, magazines began to be published in many European countries, which described in detail the process of creating various gizmos using this technique, for example, picture frames, tea boxes, caskets, and baskets.  The history of quilling then really experienced flourishing.  The facts of the organization of these training courses on paper rolling in the most elite educational institutions are known.  Even some crowned persons were fond of this art.  In particular, the daughter of George II, Elizabeth, spent hours creating intricate paper masterpieces.  Once she presented her doctor with an unusual gift in the form of a screen made using the quilling technique.  A little later, other paper personalities appreciated this paper art.  For example, he was fond of Queen Mary and Queen Alexander, <span>Jane Austen</span> and the Bronte sisters. </p><h2>  Quilling in North America </h2><p>  The colonialists ‚Äúbrought‚Äù quilling to North America.  There, in the first half of the 19th century, he not only earned popularity as a decorative and applied art, but also began to be used by cabinet makers.  They used quilling in the manufacture of boxes and caskets, in which they made insert walls decorated with quilling elements.  This unusual treatment is called "mosaic". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Oblivion </h2><p>  At the end of the XIX century, the popularity of quilling began to decline, almost to complete oblivion.  Only a few ladies of that time were addicted to it, thus filling up their free time.  At the very beginning of the twentieth century, this style was almost forgotten to be reborn again in modern times. </p><h2>  The modern history of quilling technology </h2><p>  A few years later, the Princess of England, Elizabeth, revived quilling.  She became interested in this hobby.  And, so to speak, set the same example to others.  Many of Elizabeth‚Äôs creations have become exhibits in London museums. </p><p>  Quilling fans are all over the world.  For example, in England in 1983, lovers of this art created a real Quilling Union of England corporation, where a resident of any country and continent can write a letter to get advice or hear the opinion of a specialist about his new masterpiece.  On the initiative of the members of this union, in 1992, the first International Quilling Festival was organized.  Within the framework of this event, many exhibitions were organized at which it was possible to see old products and modern creations created by paper rolling. </p>

The first of them took place in London in 1927.  And the second half a century later, in 1988 in New York.  In the halls of the Florian-Papp Gallery, truly masterpieces made using this technique were on sale.

The creations of European masters of this style were not of such a large-scale nature as Korean ones.  They were the first to create figures of high complexity and incredible beauty.  Yes, the history of quilling did not begin in Korea, but it was there that from a modest hobby, this technique turned into a form of art.  In South Korea, there is the "Association of <span>Paper Plastic</span> Lovers <span>",</span> which brings together followers of various areas of paper art. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Korean school of quilling has slightly different canons and traditions than in the European.  The works of European masters are mainly made of a small number of details;  they are very concise, similar to mosaics, are an ornament for cards and frames.  Europe is always in a hurry, therefore, prefers fast technology.  Masters of the East, on the contrary, are thorough in everything.  They create things that resemble masterpieces of jewelry.  In their works, luxury and delight are felt.  In them, like voluminous lace, threads are woven from hundreds of the smallest details. </p><p>  The history of the origin of quilling is told only in chronicles and historical essays, because very few medieval masterpieces have survived to this day.  The reason for this is the fragility and fragility of the paper.  Of course, now the quality of paper has increased several times, which allows you to create using quilling and filigree volume coasters, and vases for sweets, and much more.  I would like to hope that the history of quilling will continue, and in the future masters will learn how to create even more interesting masterpieces from paper. </p>
