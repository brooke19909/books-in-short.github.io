Both gadgets of an average hand, and especially flagships today allow their owners to transfer data at speeds not previously available.  But not everyone can afford an expensive smartphone.  And the developers went to meet the users, starting to produce <span>low-cost devices</span> with support for LTE-networks.  The product from MTS Smart Sprint is deservedly considered one of the best budget smartphones that provide the ability to work in 4G networks.  We‚Äôll talk about him today. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  This 4G smartphone is made of fairly cheap plastic, so it is very soft to the touch.  The white color collects dirt very much and after a few weeks of use loses its presentable appearance.  The black version of the case is slightly better in this regard.  There is almost no dust and fingerprints left on the back cover, but the front panel and the screen "blur" very quickly. </p><p>  On the front side of the model, under the screen, there are three standard touch keys.  A light alert indicator and a small peephole of the front camera are visible above the display.  Next to them is a conversational speaker.  On the right side of the device is the power button of the smartphone and a key that controls the volume.  The left end is empty.  At the bottom of the device is a microphone, at the top is a headset jack (3.5 mm) and a mini-USB bay.  On the rear panel are equipped with a main camera and LED flash.  At the bottom is a microphone.  By the way, the reviews say that his location was not chosen very well, since holding the device in his hands, a person closes the sound hole with his palm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Overall dimensions: 136x68x11 mm. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The 4G-smartphone from MTS has a very decent screen for its class.  The 4.5-inch display is endowed with an IPS-matrix and a resolution of 960x540.  The color rendition is quite bright, but the viewing angles are far from ideal, but quite acceptable.  It‚Äôs nice to play or watch videos on your smartphone.  Of course, the resolution of 720 r is sorely lacking, but let's not forget that the gadget belongs to the budget category.  In general, judging by the reviews of the owners, there are no complaints about the screen: the sensor is working properly, the colors are saturated, and the brightness is high. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The smartphone is <span>equipped</span> with a dual-core processor <span>MediaTek MT6572.</span>  Each core operates at a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  512 MB of RAM are responsible for working with applications, and the Mali 400 video accelerator is responsible for the graphic component of the device. To store data, the MTC Smart Sprint 4G Sim smartphone by default has only 4 GB.  But experienced consumers claim that they will be able to expand with the help of microSD memory cards.  MTS 4G smartphone recognizes flash drives up to 32 GB. </p><p>  Speaking about networks and wireless modules, I would like to mention Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS and, of course, the operation of LTE networks.  The average data acquisition speed is approximately 48 Mbit, and the transmission is 7 Mbit.  The indicators, as you can see, are pretty good.  As we can see, LTE support is not installed here just for show, because the networks have pretty good speed, which is why the smartphone provides decent competition to gadgets from the budget price segment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The MTC 4G smartphone has very mediocre optics, but still, if necessary, the device can be used as a camera, but only if the lighting is good.  The 5 megapixel camera has autofocus and an LED flash.  Photos come out pretty good when shooting outdoors in the afternoon, indoors, but a lot of noise appears on dark objects.  With a lack of lighting, the optics distort colors, it becomes indecently a lot, and the flash, judging by the words of users, copes with the backlight uselessly.  In the dark, the device is definitely impossible to photograph. </p><p>  Speaking about video shooting, it is worth mentioning that the smartphone allows you to make videos with a resolution of 720 r at a frequency of 30 frames / sec.  Here the situation is exactly the same as with the photo: in the afternoon you can shoot a good video sequence, in the dark the image quality becomes simply terrible. </p>

    <p>  <span>The front camera</span> has only 0.5 megapixels and is installed here, most likely, just for the sake of a tick, since it will not work to achieve a decent shot.  If on a relatively small screen of the gadget the photo still looks more or less tolerable, then on a large monitor it becomes completely unpleasant to look at it.  If you wish, you can post such a photo on a social network - nothing more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There‚Äôs nothing special to say about the camera‚Äôs functionality, since all options are standard for devices of this kind, and the developers, unfortunately, do not offer us any interesting solutions. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  According to the owners, this 4G-smartphone has a very average sound.  When you hold the device in your hand, as mentioned above, there is a risk of covering the speaker with your palm, which is why the sound is muffled.  This phenomenon is especially inconvenient in the process of watching videos or games.  As for the quality of melodies, it does not stand out here for anything interesting.  In principle, the device can be used as a player, but it cannot become a full replacement for an MP3 device.  The kit comes with a very weak headset, so it will most likely have to be replaced with more expensive headphones right away. </p>

    <h2>  games and applications </h2><p>  Good filling of the device and a good screen allow you to use many popular applications.  Resource-intensive software is unlikely to work normally on a smartphone, but mid-level programs are handled perfectly. </p><p>  As for games, the gadget is quite capable of launching fairly high-quality products, but not at the highest graphic settings.  Of course, MTS Smart Sprint 4G smartphones cannot play games from the TOP category correctly.  But still, it is unlikely that someone will purchase this device as a portable multimedia center or game console. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  For autonomous work there is a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1800 mAh.  If you believe the reviews, on your smartphone you can watch the video for 3.5 hours.  The combined use of social networks and music will ‚Äúeat‚Äù the battery in about 6.5 hours.  The moderate use of all energy-consuming options (music, internet, games, video, communication) led to the device requiring a charge after 5 hours of use. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Smartphone MTC Smart Sprint 4G Sim has shown itself on the good side.  Excellent operation of LTE networks, high-quality screen, good assembly, good photo in daylight conditions, decent stand-alone performance, an excellent set of modern applications and options.  Of the minuses, we distinguish terrible shooting with a lack of light, the surface of the case collecting dirt and fingerprints, a frankly weak front camera, a fairly small amount of RAM and only 4 GB for storing data by default.  As you can see, the only significant drawbacks are lack of RAM and weak selfie optics, and as for everything else, the product from MTS was pleasantly impressed: for 4,280 rubles we get a good gadget with high-quality work of new generation networks. </p><h2>  4G smartphone: reviews about the brainchild of MTS </h2><p>  The smartphone has received positive reviews about the design.  Most users liked the assembly of the case: the design is pretty good.  There are complaints about poor-quality material on which dirt and fingerprints remain.  Moreover, many note that it is very difficult to erase them later, and subsequently they will soon appear anyway. </p>

    <p>  Technical characteristics of the users came in handy.  Owners believe that for such a price, 4G and a dual-core processor are a real gift for those who need a 4G LTE smartphone.  Nubia is unlikely to be able to create such a cheap and high-quality device with support for 4G networks.  As for performance, the gadget does not cause any complaints: applications and games are going fine.  Color reproduction and a good sound from the speaker are completely immersed in the game universe, from which it will not work for a long time.  In addition, most modern options are launched on the device, because of which its use becomes more productive.  Also, many were impressed by the smart work of 4G networks. </p><p>  Now about the cameras.  Smartphone MTS Smart Sprint 4G Sim received mixed reviews.  According to the owners, using the main optics, you can take good pictures with sufficient lighting.  Night shooting was criticized.  Also, most users scold the front camera of the device, which is frankly weak. </p><p>  But the battery life of the people who purchased the smartphone we are considering were satisfied.  The batteries last for several days without recharging, subject to moderate use.  At the same time, owners quite actively use Internet surfing, often call and regularly listen to music.  In this regard, the smartphone did not disappoint. </p><p>  The best 4G-smartphone in the budget category (according to many) has received mostly positive reviews, since the device from MTS has a good price-quality ratio and almost completely meets the expectations of the owners. </p>
