The city is also called the natural gate between the central part of the country and Siberia.  It is this factor that played a decisive role in the fate of the settlement; to date, Yekaterinburg is a strategic center that provides a link between the Asian and European parts of Russia. </p><p>  The city has a 300-year history, so there are many interesting and noteworthy places on its territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="i-love-tourism.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Historical photo" class="if uuid-2263458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2263458.jpg"></div><h2>  Labor Square </h2><p>  In Yekaterinburg, this area is one of the central.  Previously, it was called Church, then Catherine. </p><p>  It was laid back in the twenties of the last century.  Until this period, wealthy people lived here in stone estates.  With the advent of Soviet power, the building of the Regional Executive Committee appeared on the site of the houses.  This is a whole complex of buildings, the construction of which was completed in 1928.  Opposite the building is the Communication House.  And next to it is a building that at one time served as a pharmacy, built in the 1920s. </p><div class="photo" data-original="i-love-tourism.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the chapel" class="if uuid-2263448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2263448.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  Labor Square in Yekaterinburg is located in the historical and central part of the city, just a few steps away - Plotinka.  The area is located between the streets: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Pushkin; </li><li>  Gorky; </li><li>  Lenin Avenue. </li></ul><p>  The square also has common borders with Plotinka. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.ngzt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain &quot;Stone Flower&quot;" class="if uuid-2263450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2263450.jpg"></div><h2>  Palace on the square </h2><p>  An architecturally interesting building on Yekaterinburg Labor Square is Sevastyanov’s House-Palace.  It was built back in 1866 by the famous architect Paduchev A.M.  The house is made in several styles: from eclecticism to neo-Gothic.  This palace house is listed as a federal landmark.  Even on a three-ruble silver coin this building is depicted (year of issue - 2008). </p><h2>  Fountain, chapel and monument </h2><p>  In the middle of Labor Square in Yekaterinburg there is a fountain - "Stone Flower".  And in the old days there was a temple on this place, but with the advent of the Bolsheviks it was demolished.  The temple was built in the XVIII century (classicism style). </p><p>  A little later a fountain appeared, the waters of which hit directly from a concrete low base.  Already in 1962, the Stone Flower was erected.  The bowl of the fountain is lined with pink marble.  The flower itself is made of metal.  In the area is broken square. </p><p>  In honor of the celebration of the 275th anniversary of the city (in 1998), a stone chapel was erected near the fountain on Labor Square in Yekaterinburg. </p><p>  In the same year, a monument was erected closer to the dam in honor of the founders of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="i-love-tourism.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the founders of the city" class="if uuid-2263451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2263451.jpg"></div><h2>  Square </h2><p>  Around the fountain (back in 1932), tracks for visitors and flower beds were designed.  Now it is a small “live” hedge of the square with 11 trees and 240 bushes.  Flowers here are planted perennial and annual.  In spring and summer, the park is very beautiful and picturesque. </p><h2>  To be or not to be a church </h2><p>  The debate about the need to rebuild the church on the square for many years does not leave the front pages of local newspapers.  The Yekaterinburg diocese was the initiator of the meeting of the town-planning council.  However, no consensus was reached, and the diocese was unable to prove the need for construction.  This issue has been tabled for public discussion.  At that time (2010), almost the entire Internet audience was “against”, according to some estimates, from 70% to 92%.  The Socium fund, which conducted a survey at the end of the year, speaks about the same figures, and only 15% voted in favor. </p><p>  Most of all there was indignation that part of the square would be taken away for construction.  For residents of Yekaterinburg, such “green islands” are very important, because the city is very densely built up.  In April 2010, even a rally was held on the square, 3591 signatures “against” the construction were collected.  Nevertheless, the diocese in 2015 again presented a project for the restoration of the church, which again did not find public support.  In March 2016, the diocese abandoned its plans. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.83832980251464" data-lng="60.607388199830666" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="18"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/8/0/780.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Where is Labor Square in Yekaterinburg located?  The location is very easy to reach by public transport.  The nearest metro station is “Area 1905”, 450 meters from it. </p><p>  From the bus stop of the same name only 120 meters (the corner of Lenin Avenue and Pushkin Street).  Musical Comedy Theater Tram Stop is 350 meters away. </p><p>  The address on Labor Square in Yekaterinburg is one - No. 1, and it refers to the chapel, all other buildings are located on the other, for example, the former building of the Regional Committee - on Lenin Avenue, 34, and Sevastyanov's house - on Lenin Avenue, 35. </p><p>  Area coordinates: 56 ° 50.296 ′ s.  w.  and 60 ° 36.416 ′ in.  d. </p>
