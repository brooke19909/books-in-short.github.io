  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cross stitch pattern, features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cross stitching as one of the most common needlework techniques allows not only to create beautiful paintings, but also to show imagination, embodying various images on the canvas.  Since ancient times, people believed that crosses keep magic in themselves and can protect against evil forces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cross pattern" class="if uuid-2672419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2672419.jpg"></div><p>  Cross stitch patterns of the dragon combine magical symbolism and colorful execution.  They are used both in decoration and for applied type. </p><h2>  Materials for the process </h2><p>  Not only the quality of work, but also the durability of the canvas itself depends on the selected materials.  If the threads are of poor quality, then the color quickly fades.  A loose canvas can create many problems in the design process, and marking with simple pencils threatens not to be removed. </p><p>  To avoid these problems, the craftswomen recommend the use of quality elements.  A well-organized process speeds up embroidery.  To work, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Mouline thread.  If the picture is voluminous, it is advisable to use wool; cotton threads are suitable for ordinary work.  Silk is used for stitching. </li><li>  The cloth.  The base can be of different counts (the larger the count, the denser the base and the holes are smaller).  For full sewing, the use of a canvas of 14 counts will be ideal, for metrics and applied work, uniform weave fabrics are suitable. </li><li>  Needles and hoops.  In the process, stretching the base is important so that the canvas does not sag.  This will ensure the most even and accurate crosses. </li><li>  Water soluble markers.  The markup helps not to make a mistake in the process of otshiva a lot of work.  To do this, it is better to select or monofilament, or special water-soluble markers. </li></ul><p>  As for the scheme, quality and originality are also important here.  Otherwise, the embroiderer can sew a run or a low-quality sample.  Cross stitch patterns for the dragon can be found in the public domain (one of them is presented below) or order a set with the image you like on the Internet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Scheme selection </h2><p>  Depending on the type of embroidery and what it will be intended for, you can choose the right option.  The pattern for embroidering the dragon with a cross can be either for full or partial sewing.  It is better for novice embroiderers to choose monochrome options, this will help to quickly see the result and will be the first step in the study of the pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="motherbeedesigns.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monochrome option" class="if uuid-2672430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2672430.jpg"></div><p>  As for the operating parameters, it is also not worthwhile to immediately choose large canvases, since this requires effort and time.  For cross-stitch dragons free patterns can be found in needlework magazines. </p><p>  Pay attention to the presence of a key.  The indicated threads by numbers greatly facilitate the work, rather than only approximate indicators.  In order for the cross stitch pattern to be convenient for work, its icons should be well-read and should be of normal size. </p><p>  In some sets, the scheme is printed on glossy paper.  For greater convenience, it is better to scan it on a regular one, so that it does not glare in the process. </p><h2>  Symbolism of the image </h2><p>  The cross-stitch pattern of a dragon with a pearl symbolizes the wealth and harmony of material and moral goods.  It is a symbol of the wisdom of millennia and the strength of ancestors.  In ancient times, in eastern countries, the dragon was portrayed near the front door. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Partial sewing" class="if uuid-2672424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2672424.jpg"></div><p>  People believed that in this way the one who steps on the threshold is cleared of negativity and enters the house only with good thoughts.  The pearl embodies strength and confidence, and in the material plane - full cup and wealth. </p><p>  Although many needlewomen consider this interpretation to be free and put their value into this image, in general terms it is a sign of accumulation and positive experience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coricamo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's motive" class="if uuid-2672426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2672426.jpg"></div><h2>  Needlewoman Tips </h2><p>  In the process of embroidery, you can decorate or add interesting decorative elements to improve the look.  This is especially true for paintings with full sewing, when you need to attract attention with the original addition. </p><p>  In the pattern of embroidering a dragon with a cross with a pearl, you can make a sewing element from beads or make this detail with beads to add shine and volume to the work. </p><p>  The use of a crossbar to highlight details will also be relevant in this case, but it is better to fold the thread several times and alternate silver and golden floss to achieve a plausible effect. </p><p>  To make mother-of-pearl ebb on the parts of the dragon and the pearl itself, needlewomen advise using silk threads, but they need to be alternated with an ordinary floss to maintain the contrast of the transitions. </p>
