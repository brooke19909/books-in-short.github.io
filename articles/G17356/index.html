Traveling along it is a pleasure.  Ancient castles and monasteries, picturesque nature - I just want to photograph everything around.  Roads in Georgia are in good condition.  In this article we will describe how to get from Kutaisi to Tbilisi.  The country is quite elongated from west to east.  Therefore, these two cities are separated by a considerable distance - 226 kilometers.  How to overcome it?  We will tell you.  Read our article and go explore the capital of Georgia from the ancient resort city of Kutaisi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from kutaisi to tbilisi" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1979215.jpg" width="587"></div>

    <h2>  Airplane </h2><p>  The air mode of transport is rightly considered the fastest.  But not on this route.  In solving the problem of how to get from Kutaisi to Tbilisi, the plane should be completely rejected.  Why - after all, in both cities there are airports?  The reason is pretty simple.  There is no direct flight connecting the capital of Georgia with the western city.  You will have to get with transfers.  The journey will take about 15 hours.  And such a trip will cost a lot - at least four hundred lari (9,400 rubles).  Not to mention the hassle of getting to the airport and waiting an hour and a half before departure.  Kutaisi air gates are located 17 kilometers from the city.  And another ten lari (235 rubles) will need to be laid out for the road to it.  And taking into account the fact that you still have to admire the transit hall at the transfer point for about five hours, you cannot call such a trip a pleasure.  In a word, D&amp;G is Expensive and Stupid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from tbilisi to kutaisi train" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1979222.jpg" width="600"></div>
