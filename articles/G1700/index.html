After all, this is one of the most profitable offers today: a minimum of documents, an interest rate from 13 to 17% per annum, a loan amount of up to 5 million rubles.  The initial installment for a car loan from Sberbank is minimal - from 15%.  Information on 90% of approved applications is also impressive. </p><h2>  How to get a car loan at Sberbank? </h2><p>  Imagine step-by-step instructions in the form of a diagram (see the photo below): </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get a loan from Sberbank?" class="if uuid-2638060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2638060.jpg"></div><p>  On the official website of Sberbank, a car loan calculator allows you to calculate the size of the monthly payment.  This is very convenient - you can immediately evaluate your capabilities.  Now about each item in more detail. </p><h2>  How to fill out a questionnaire so that you are not refused? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.cobalt.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to fill out an application form?" class="if uuid-2640531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2640531.jpg"></div><p>  First, let's see what requirements are placed on the borrower - you should not even waste time if you do not meet them.  And then we will analyze the nuances of how to get a car loan at Sberbank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Borrower Requirements" class="if uuid-2641187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2641187.jpg"></div><p>  A loan is issued only on the security of the purchased car, so the requirements are quite loyal: </p><ul><li><p>  You must be 21 years old. </p></li><li><p>  on the date of repayment of the loan you should not be 75 years old; </p></li><li><p>  you must work for at least six months at the last place of work, and over the past 5 years, your work experience should be at least a year (for Sberbank's salary clients - 6 months, 3 of them - at the last place of work). </p></li></ul><p>  What is the interest rate on a car loan in Sberbank?  It all depends on the category of the borrower.  On a common basis, you can count on 16-17% per annum.  For salary clients - from 14% per annum.  And if refinancing is carried out after 12 months, then the rate can be completely reduced to 10% per annum. </p><p>  And from the documents for a car loan in Sberbank, you only need a passport and a second document.  If you are a payroll client, you do not need to confirm income. </p><h2>  The nuances of filling out a car loan application form at Sberbank </h2><p>  The application for a car loan in Sberbank is a 5-page PDF document.  You can download it by the link located on the official website of the bank.  Next, it will need to be printed and filled out by hand, be sure to use a blue ballpoint pen and block letters.  A sample of the completed questionnaire can also be found on the website. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pre-use the car loan calculator from Sberbank and calculate the size of the monthly payment.  It should not exceed 50% of your income.  By the way, the calculator will tell you what the interest rate on a car loan in Sberbank with certain parameters. </p><h2>  Indicate real contacts </h2><p>  How to get a car loan at Sberbank and avoid a failure?  First of all, indicate only reliable information about yourself.  All information is carefully checked by the security service, and specially hired people will call the numbers you specify.  If it turns out that you lied somewhere or no one answers the call, they will probably refuse you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Enter the contact details correctly" class="if uuid-2638714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2638714.jpg"></div><p>  Pay special attention to the section "Contact Information" - all phones must be real.  Remember that today it is possible to establish at what address it is installed and to whom this or that telephone is registered in 5 minutes.  Moreover, with the capabilities of the Sberbank security service. </p><p>  If the number you specified is not serviced or is set to the wrong address that you indicated on the questionnaire, they will be informed about this very quickly and you will receive a guaranteed refusal. </p><p>  It is also advisable that at work they know about your desire to get a car loan at Sberbank, be ready to answer the call and be sure to confirm the information you specified in the questionnaire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There were times when a sudden call from a bank employee frightened a person who picked up the phone.  And he immediately threw it.  Or he answered that, they say, "you didn‚Äôt get there."  If this person had been warned in advance, he would have probably reacted more adequately. </p><p>  The bank will take this as an attempt to cheat on your part.  But in fact, the employee who picked up the phone was simply confused and did not know what to say - for many, calls from the bank are associated with troubles due to outstanding debt.  It would be a shame to be refused because of such a trifle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="This data will affect your credit limit." class="if uuid-2638717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2638717.jpg"></div><h2>  Realize your possibilities </h2><p>  Here's another secret how to get a car loan at Sberbank.  Do not allow the bank to independently form an opinion about you.  Form the opinion of the bank yourself. </p><p>  Please note that the more dependents you have (children, parents and other relatives who live at your expense and depend on your income) and constant payments (for utilities, apartment rental), the lower your credit limit.  It‚Äôs better to describe everything in detail - what expenses and how much you spend every month. </p><p>  Let's say you have 2 children and a husband who also works.  You also have a father and mother who work and receive a pension - they do not depend on you financially, but you help them from time to time. </p><h2>  Prove your financial viability to the bank </h2><p>  It is important for the bank to understand that you adequately assess the risks, and a decrease in your cash flow due to loan repayments will not harm your budget.  Therefore, your task is to show the bank how you can repay the loan. </p><p>  Attach 2 financial statements to the application.  In the first, write down your expenses (enlarged, don‚Äôt include every package of milk there - confine yourself to the ‚Äúfood‚Äù category) and incomes ‚Äî show what your financial situation was like before getting a loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Make a financial report for the bank" class="if uuid-2638719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2638719.jpg"></div><p>  It will be great if you can document not only the main income - salary, but also all additional income.  It is also worthwhile to submit a financial report to your parents - to show the bank that they are not financially dependent on you and are able to provide for themselves, as well as the spouse - his income will help to survive a possible crisis. </p><p>  The bank should see that your financial situation is stable and you do not need money for current expenses, on the contrary, there are ‚Äúsurpluses‚Äù that you invest correctly. </p><p>  Then having children will only be beneficial for you - for the bank this is an additional guarantee that you will not hide. </p><p>  In the second report, include loan payments - show the bank how you will cope with the increased costs.  Just be realistic - no one will believe that you will live on 20,000, if before that your expenses were 80,000 rubles. </p><p>  This approach will significantly increase your chances of obtaining a loan.  Indeed, in this case, the bank will take into account specifically your situation, and not the average data. </p><p>  In addition, you will immediately show that you are responsible in fulfilling your obligations and adequately assess the risks.  So you can be trusted with money. </p><h2>  What awaits you and how to behave in a branch of Sberbank? </h2><p>  As mentioned above, it is better to prepare for a trip to the bank in advance - to collect documents, prepare contacts and warn all interested parties.  Then the registration procedure will pass quickly, and the likelihood of approval will be many times higher. </p><p>  It is also advisable to print and fill out the questionnaire in advance - this will save a lot of time.  In addition, at home, in a relaxed atmosphere, you can once again carefully weigh the pros and cons.  And also double-check all the information and prepare in advance the answers to the "tricky" questions (and documents - for confirmation).  All this is necessary to appear before the bank in the most favorable light. </p><p>  The process of registration itself does not take much time - a loan officer will check the documents, take the necessary photocopies and transfer the information further. </p><p>  Documents can be issued directly at the dealership, if there is a bank representative.  It‚Äôs even easier - you don‚Äôt have to wait in line at the department.  And the decision in this case, the bank, as a rule, takes faster. </p><p>  And one more secret - when dealing with bank employees, behave confidently and independently.  It‚Äôs as if you don‚Äôt need money at all.  Feel free to take an interest in the conditions, carefully read each document and do not agree to the first sentence - show that you have plenty to choose from. </p><p>  Let the bank be interested in taking money from you.  And this is only possible if you have previously prepared and are ready to prove your ability to handle them and your solvency. </p><p>  What documents must be provided without fail? </p><p>  There are only three of them: </p><ul><li><p>  passport, </p></li><li><p>  the second document (to choose - SNILS, TIN, driver‚Äôs license, military ID, passport), </p></li><li><p>  application form. </p></li></ul><p>  As you can see, even proof of income is not required.  But this is only for the salary clients of Sberbank and with the amount of the down payment - from 30% of the cost of the car.  The rest will still have to confirm their employment and income. </p><h2>  How long does a car loan decision have to wait and what does it depend on? </h2><p>  You will have to wait for a decision on a car loan - from 2 hours to 4 days.  And this is not the limit - the term can be further increased - by decision of the bank.  After all, the security service must check not only the information you specified in the questionnaire, but also the car dealership. </p><p>  But you can not worry that the car will suddenly be stolen.  Or she will suddenly have a double somewhere in another region. </p><p>  Often unscrupulous sellers underestimate the real mileage or hide that the car was in an accident.  This will be revealed much later, when the iron begins to rot, and on the road the car will behave unpredictably. </p><p>  When taking a car loan at Sberbank, you are insured against these problems: they will give you a loan for a new car and the bank‚Äôs security service will carefully check the car dealership.  Sberbank will not cooperate with dubious partners. </p><p>  But such a check takes time.  Therefore, the decision on the loan will have to wait.  Therefore, it is advantageous to buy a car in a salon that has already been tested and has been cooperating with Sberbank for a long time.  So you save time and the likelihood of approval will be higher. </p><h2>  What to consider when choosing a car? </h2><p>  It is important to correctly calculate your capabilities.  Buying an expensive car is not only prestige, but also significant costs.  This includes refueling, insurance, maintenance, repair, car washing and dry cleaning, taxes. </p><p>  Can you pay a loan and maintain such a car?  Is it possible that the car will be in the garage, but you still have to pay for it?  Remember that there is always a chance of losing one or several sources of income.  What will you do in this case? </p><p>  It is necessary not only to answer these questions to yourself, but also to show the bank how you will cope with these problems. </p><h2>  What you need to know about insurance? </h2><p>  Surely the bank will require to insure the car against three main risks in the CASCO: loss, theft and damage.  In this case, you will receive from the insurance only money for car repairs.  But if it cannot be repaired, the creditor will receive insurance money. </p><p>  The insurance company will offer you a bank - from its accredited list.  You don‚Äôt have to go anywhere.  The contract is executed directly on the spot - at a bank branch or car dealership. </p><p>  Be prepared for the fact that you have to insure the car immediately for the entire duration of the loan agreement - up to 5 years.  The good news is that insurance can be included in the loan amount - you don‚Äôt have to pay in cash. </p><h2>  What is required to conclude a loan agreement? </h2><p>  We will present the necessary documents in the form of a diagram: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Documents for concluding a loan agreement" class="if uuid-2638710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2638710.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, you will also have to draw up a pledge agreement for the purchased car - you can use it, but you cannot sell it.  And in case of problems with payments, the bank will confiscate the car and sell it. </p><h2>  How is a loan issued? </h2><p>  The loan is approved and all documents are signed.  The last formalities remained.  To receive money you need to open a universal account.  Then, payment will be made from him to the account of the car dealership and the insurance company, if necessary. </p><p>  However, experts do not recommend including insurance on credit - this way you show the bank your need for cash.  The lender may have doubts about your ability to service the car in the future.  Moreover, it is quite reasonable.  After all, if you have not taken care of insurance, where is the guarantee that you thought about everything else? </p><p>  If you nevertheless made up your mind to this, show the bank that you are doing this not because of a lack of cash, but in order to allocate resources more efficiently. </p><p>  Suppose you have a reserve fund that you could partially use to pay for insurance.  However, you save it in case of loss of work - the only source of income.  And even in this case, you can make payments.  A similar reason looks reasonable and will only add you ‚Äúpoints‚Äù in the eyes of the bank. </p><p>  Do not ignore the bottlenecks.  On the contrary, tell the bank yourself why the situation looks like this and what you are going to do.  Show how to handle this.  And try to prove it with examples from the past. </p><p>  It is convenient to pay for a car loan in Sberbank online, through the Internet banking system.  So you do not have to pay an additional commission and go to the bank branch. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Sberbank has not previously offered car loans to individuals.  So, back in 2017, only a consumer loan could be issued.  Perhaps other similar products will be available soon.  This will make the conditions for obtaining a car loan in Sberbank even more profitable. </p>
