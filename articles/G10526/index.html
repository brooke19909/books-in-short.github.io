In today's article, we will talk about the most popular problems that cause SMS to stop coming to your phone, and also look at ways to fix possible problems. </p><h2>  Memory full </h2><p>  The first and most common reason why SMS does not come to the phone is to fill the internal memory of the device.  And although modern gadgets have a sufficient amount of memory, sooner or later it is still full, and messages simply cease to arrive.  This problem is especially common on older phone models and on modern ultra-budget ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.overmemory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS do not come to the phone due to full memory" class="if uuid-2535133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2535133.jpg"></div><p>  Many are sure that if you connect a memory card to the device, the problem will disappear, but this is not so.  Messages never use external storage devices and are stored only in the phone‚Äôs memory.  Correcting the problem is actually quite simple - you need to clear the internal memory of all excess garbage.  You can do this yourself by deleting all old unnecessary messages, call logs and applications installed on the internal memory.  But it is best to use some special application for deeper cleaning, for example SD-Maid or CCleaner Mobile. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Incorrect settings </h2><p>  The next reason why SMS does not come to the phone is incorrect settings or resetting message settings.  As a rule, when a SIM card is connected to the phone, all parameters for messages are set immediately, but it also happens that they ‚Äúfly off‚Äù as a result of a software failure or a user‚Äôs fault.  It can sometimes be very difficult to identify a problem, because few people even think that settings can be reset.  Perhaps this is one of the most insidious reasons why SMS does not arrive on the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otvet.mail.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS do not come to the phone due to incorrect settings" class="if uuid-2535149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2535149.jpg"></div><p>  What to do with this malfunction?  Here is the procedure.  First you need to go to the website of the cellular operator that owns the SIM.  Now you should find the number of the SMS center on the website.  As a rule, such information is given only in the user's personal account, so you have to register.  When the coveted number is received, it will be necessary to enter it into the phone.  To do this, go to the SMS application and open its settings.  There should be an item "SMS-center".  You must go into it and enter the number in the appropriate field. </p><h2>  Flight mode </h2><p>  Another well-known reason why SMS does not arrive on the phone is flight mode turned on.  Many users like to use it in order to stay in silence for some time, without making any calls, etc. Unfortunately, most people forget to turn off this mode after a certain time, because of which they do not receive any calls , neither messages, nor other alerts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="i2hard.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS do not come to the phone due to flight mode" class="if uuid-2535134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2535134.jpg"></div><p>  Fortunately, the problem is fixed simply - you just need to turn off the flight mode.  You can do this either from the phone‚Äôs settings, or through the status bar, or through the shutdown menu that appears when you hold down the power button. </p><h2>  SIM card or tray </h2><p>  Often the problem that SMS does not arrive on the phone is a SIM card or tray for it.  Yes, this also happens, and, alas, the reasons for the failure of the SIM card are often unknown.  As one of the options - marriage during production. </p><p>  In addition to the SIM card itself, the tray for it can also fail.  The contacts in the connector often break off, oxidize due to moisture or simply fail due to burnout or all the same marriage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Motorola_Moto_G_3rd_Generation"><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS do not come to the phone" class="if uuid-2534228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2534228.jpg"></div><p>  You can solve the problem with a faulty SIM card only by replacing the card itself.  As for the tray, there are several options.  If we are talking about the oxidation of contacts, then they can always be cleaned with a cotton swab and soda.  If one of the contacts is broken or the tray is faulty, then only replacing with a new one will help. </p>
