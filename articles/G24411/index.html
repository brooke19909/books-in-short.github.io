    <h2>  What are LEDs? </h2><p>  Before considering the common types of LEDs, we will study the general information about the corresponding devices.  An LED is a semiconductor that is capable of converting electrical current into light.  In this case, the semiconductor crystal, which is its main component, consists of several layers characterized by 2 types of conductivity.  Namely - hole and electronic. </p><p>  The conductivity of the first type involves the transition of an electron from one atom to another, on which there is free space.  In turn, another electron comes to the first atom, another one to the previous one, etc. This mechanism acts due to covalent bonds between the atoms.  However, their movement does not occur.  In fact, a positive charge moves, which physicists conventionally call a hole.  In this case, when an electron transfers to holes, light is released. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In its structure, the LED as a whole is similar to a rectifier diode.  That is, it has 2 outputs - anode and cathode.  This feature determines the need to observe the polarity when connecting the LED to the electric current source. </p>

    <p>  Corresponding products are generally calculated for a direct current of 20 milliamps.  In principle, this value can be reduced, however, in this case, the color may change and the brightness of the LED may decrease.  In turn, increasing the corresponding parameter is undesirable.  If the current exceeds the optimal value, then in order to reduce it to the required level, a limiting resistor is used. </p><p>  There are quite a few nuances that should be borne in mind when installing LEDs.  This is predetermined by their internal structure, form of execution.  In some cases, it may be necessary to use a stabilizer for LEDs and other electronic components to ensure the operation of the device in which the product in question is installed. </p><p>  Depending on the composition of the semiconductors in the LED, it can be red, yellow, green or blue.  For example, if the structure of the corresponding electronic component contains gallium nitride, then the LED will glow blue.  Actually, one of the criteria, based on which certain types of LEDs are allocated, may be their color. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Application </h2><p>  The first LEDs on the market were manufactured in metal cases.  Gradually, plastic began to replace him.  In this case, by color, it is usually selected taking into account the color of the LED glow.  However, transparent plastic cases are also quite common. </p><p>  Considered electronic devices are widely used in various fields.  This is due to the fact that almost all <span>types of LEDs are</span> characterized by: </p><p>  - energy efficiency; </p><p>  - long service life; </p><p>  - the ability to determine the color of the glow, as well as adjust its power; </p><p>  - security; </p><p>  - environmental friendliness. </p><p>  If we talk about energy efficiency, LEDs with the same light output can have significantly lower power than conventional lamps.  A lower LED power reduces the overall load on the building‚Äôs power system.  The service life of devices can be several tens of times that which characterizes ordinary lamps.  At the same time, from the point of view of functions, LEDs can be completely inferior to them. </p>

    <p>  With the formation of mass demand for such products, as well as their cost reduction, LEDs are increasingly used for the same purposes as conventional lamps.  There are no difficulties in installing appropriate solutions in comparison with traditional lighting devices.  It is only important to make sure that a particular LED is suitable for installation in the power grid of a room.  For this, you may need to identify its main parameters in advance - before purchasing LEDs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What other benefits can these solutions have? </p><p>  So, it can be noted that the color temperature of the LED can be almost any - including the combination of the above colors.  In addition, devices can be supplemented with various filters, which can significantly expand the scope of LEDs in terms of selecting the desired color temperature. </p><p>  The ability to control the power of the glow is another advantage of the devices in question.  This option is combined with their high energy efficiency.  The power of the LED can be adjusted automatically - based on the actual conditions of use of lighting devices.  And this practically does not affect their service life. </p><p>  LEDs are environmentally friendly because they do not emit harmful types of radiation to humans.  This feature, again, expands the application of the devices in question. </p><h2>  Classification: indicator and lighting solutions </h2><p>  Experts distinguish 2 main categories of LEDs - indicator, as well as lighting.  The former are intended primarily to create a decorative lighting effect and are used as an element of decoration of a building, room, vehicle.  Or as a tool for styling text - for example, on an advertising banner. </p><p>  In turn, there are lighting LEDs.  They are designed to increase the brightness of lighting in a room or in a certain area - for example, if we consider the LEDs for cars.  The appropriate type of solution is an alternative to the use of conventional lamps and in many cases is more advantageous in terms of energy efficiency and environmental friendliness. </p><h2>  Types of Execution </h2><p>  But back to the classification of LEDs.  You can determine the widest range of grounds for their classification in one or another category.  A common approach among experts involves the allocation of the following main types of LEDs: </p><p>  - DIP; </p><p>  - Spider LED; </p><p>  - SMD; </p><p>  - COB; </p><p>  - fiber; </p><p>  - Filament. </p><p>  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><h2>  What are the specifics of DIP LEDs? </h2><p>  If you study in more detail how these types of LEDs appeared on the market, then devices of the DIP class can be attributed to the first, which began to be sold massively.  These solutions are crystals that are housed in housings with optical components, in particular a lens that creates a light beam. </p>

    <p>  It can be noted that the category of LEDs in question, despite the widespread prevalence, is rarely used in the high-tech field.  Most often, these solutions are used as components of <span>illuminated advertising,</span> ribbons, lights, decorations. </p><p>  DIP LEDs belong to the category of indicator.  They have another name - DIL.  They are installed on a board on which holes must first be made.  It can be noted that within the framework of this category, various types of LEDs can be distinguished, which differ in bulb diameter, color, and manufacturing material.  In this case, the corresponding parameters can be represented in the widest range.  In form, the solutions under consideration are cylindrical.  Among the corresponding LEDs there are both monochrome and multi-color devices. </p><h2>  Spider LED </h2><p>  This type of LEDs are generally very similar to previous devices.  But they have twice as many conclusions - 4. While DIP LEDs - 2. The fact that the presented type of solutions has more outputs optimizes heat dissipation and increases the reliability of the corresponding components.  In practice, they are used in various fields, in particular as LEDs for cars. </p><h2>  SMD type LEDs </h2><p>  These solutions are issued using the surface mount concept.  That is, they are LEDs that can be installed on any surface, while other solutions can be installed through end-to-end installation. </p><p>  The sizes of LEDs of this type can be significantly smaller than alternative solutions, as well as those designs on which they are installed.  Again, in this case, it is legitimate to talk about a more optimal heat sink.  The use of SMD type LEDs <span data-mce-mark="1">in many cases allows expanding the variability of lighting designs.</span> </p>

    <p>  SMD LEDs are classified as lighting.  They are characterized by a rather complex structure.  So, the LED itself consists of a metal substrate.  A crystal is fixed on it, which is soldered directly to the contacts of the substrate body.  A lens is placed above the crystal.  In this case, 1-3 LEDs can be installed on one substrate.  SMD includes common types of superbright LEDs, such as 3528. These solutions have a high level of demand. </p><h2>  LED type COB </h2><p>  The next popular type of LED is COB.  It is made using technology that involves installing the chip directly on the board.  This solution is characterized by a large number of advantages: </p><p>  - the protection of the compound from oxidation; </p><p>  - small dimensions of the structure; </p><p>  - heat sink efficiency; </p><p>  - reducing the cost of installing LEDs - in comparison, in particular, with devices such as SMD. </p>

    <p>  If we consider the above types of LEDs, it can be noted that COB brand solutions can be attributed to the most innovative.  For the first time, such technology was implemented by Japanese engineers in the late 2000s.  Now these types of LEDs continue to gain popularity. </p><p>  According to experts, the solutions under consideration may even become the most popular on the market, especially when it comes to the commercial segment and the sphere of domestic lighting.  It is worth noting that there are areas in which the use of COB LEDs can be difficult.  Among them is the production of professional lighting equipment.  The fact is that the LEDs under consideration are not very optimal in terms of adaptation to the organization of lighting with an established light intensity curve.  In such cases, devices such as SMD may be more suitable. </p><p>  The described diodes are lighting.  According to experts, they can be attributed to the best, based on the characteristics of the light flux.  Available in different colors, such as red, green, blue, and white.  The luminous flux of these models has a scattering angle of 40-120 degrees. </p><p>  More than 9 COB LEDs can be installed on one substrate.  They are coated with a phosphor, as a result of which they acquire high brightness.  It can be noted that the luminous flux of these solutions is higher than that of devices such as SMD.  Thus, if we consider which type of LEDs is better, then according to the specified criterion, a solution of the COB class may have an advantage. </p><p>  COB type LEDs are also used in the automotive industry.  They can be used as a component of front, rear lights, turn signals.  The main thing is to correctly install the purchased devices.  To do this, it makes sense to contact experienced professionals. </p><h2>  Fiber LEDs </h2><p>  Innovative include fiber LEDs.  They appeared on the market recently, in 2015.  The solutions in question were developed by engineers from South Korea. </p><p>  You can use these types of LEDs in the manufacture of clothing.  That is, from them it is quite possible to sew a shirt or T-shirt that can glow.  The manufacture of clothing based on fiber LEDs also involves the use of various polymers, as well as aluminum compounds. </p><h2>  LEDs Filament </h2><p>  Another example of innovative LEDs is Filament type solutions.  Their main advantage is high energy efficiency.  At the same power, for example, with LEDs such as COB, Filament solutions can provide a higher level of illumination. </p><p>  The considered <span>innovative product is</span> most often used in the manufacture of <span>lighting lamps.</span>  Among the remarkable characteristics of the production of the corresponding LEDs is the installation directly on a substrate made of glass.  This approach makes it possible to distribute the light emitted from the LED 360 degrees. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose the best option? </h2><p>  How to determine the type of LED that is optimal for a particular design?  There are a large number of criteria that you can focus on in this matter.  In principle, it is completely legitimate to determine the scope of the LED based on its classification according to the characteristics that we examined above.  We study the specifics of choosing the appropriate electronic components, taking into account the features of the devices: </p><p>  - DIP; </p><p>  - SMD; </p><p>  - COB. </p><h2>  LED Choice: Features of DIP Solutions </h2><p>  As we noted above, DIP LEDs are among the earliest products on the market.  Thus, quite old, but still in demand technologies are involved in them.  Their main advantages are ease of installation, ease of form, low power consumption, low heating, as well as a fairly high degree of protection against external influences. </p><p>  Most often, the LEDs under consideration are available in diameters of 3 and 5 mm.  If we compare the LEDs by type, we can conclude that the solutions in question are most optimal for use: </p><p>  - as elements of car tuning; </p><p>  - as decorative components; </p><p>  - as a part of low-power - as an option of self-made - lamps. </p><p>  The considered LEDs have a relatively low cost and availability in the market.  It can be noted that among the most common modifications are 12-volt LEDs.  They can be present in various online catalogs, as well as specialized stores in a wide range.  Actually, any 12-volt LEDs are characterized by a fairly high demand on the market. </p><h2>  LED Choice: Features of SMD Solutions </h2><p>  The corresponding type of solution in appearance fundamentally differs from others in that it has a flat shape.  Installation of these electronic components is without legs.  Current for SMD type LEDs is supplied to the terminals located on their reverse side. </p><p>  Thus, the installation of these devices is carried out without the use of holes.  LEDs can be placed very compactly.  As a result, the design on which the corresponding devices are located may also decrease. </p><p>  The main ways to use the devices in question are the same auto-tuning, various types of interior lighting.  Among the most significant advantages of these options are high brightness, light output.  Combined with their small size, these solutions offer significant advantages over alternative product models. </p><p>  Among the most common on the modern market is the type of LED 3528. These products are widely used in the production of LED strips.  The design of the respective products allows the production of three-color LEDs - with red, blue, and also green glow colors.  Based on type 3528 solutions, many other electronic components are manufactured, such as SMD 5050 type LEDs. </p><p>  The products in question are also characterized by affordability.  They are usually presented in the market in a wide range. </p><h2>  LED Selection: Features of COB Solutions </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that a significant part of the LEDs of the corresponding type are very powerful designs.  Their characteristic feature is the rapid scattering of light, due to the placement of crystals on the surface, which provides dynamic heat dissipation. </p><p>  The LEDs in question are very bright.  This makes them in demand just for use in the design of car headlights.  It should be noted that these products should be installed taking into account a number of significant nuances - only experienced specialists can know these.  Therefore, it is recommended that you contact the competent service department to install the appropriate solutions. </p>
