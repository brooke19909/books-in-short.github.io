Its existence began in the 18th century, which is why there are exclusive buildings, a special soul and, of course, an original population.  It is interesting that many people confuse this city with Troitsk in the Moscow Region, the sights in which are similar to Chelyabinsk: architecture of the past 3 centuries, many religious monuments, as well as a developed scientific base. </p><p>  For almost 250 years of existence in Chelyabinsk Troitsk a huge number of attractions has formed, and they attract tourists and visitors to the village.  What is worth seeing and where to go? </p><h2>  Some facts about Troitsk </h2><p>  In 1743, in the Orenburg Territory, the need arose for a special defensive fortress at the confluence of the Uvelka and Uy rivers.  This happened due to the fact that there was an important trade route connecting Asia and Europe, and nearby settlements were often raided by unwanted guests.  Troitsk became the defender of Orenburg, and soon a large trading city.  Now the village remains of great international importance, because it is located on the border with Kazakhstan. </p><p>  Troitsk received the official status of the city 40 years later, in 1784. </p><p>  At the moment, the settlement is part of the <span>Chelyabinsk region,</span> located 140 kilometers from Chelyabinsk and 1859 kilometers from Moscow. </p><p>  The population of the city is 75 thousand people.  Famous residents of the city became: Plevako F.N., Kulik L.A., Akhmerov I.A., Glazunov O.M. and many others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Architectural attractions of Troitsk </h2>

    <p>  For several centuries, a sufficient number of buildings have been erected in the city, which are now considered to be historical.  One of them is located on the street.  Malyshevs, 34, is a passage owned by the Yaushev brothers, famous in the city, in the 20th century.  The building combines several styles: neoclassicism, baroque and renaissance.  During its life, the building was in the hands of white troops during the revolution, then it became a warehouse for military supplies, and now it is on the balance sheet of the plant.  Despite the fact that some elements of the decoration of the passage have not survived to the present day, it still delights with its grace and is a special attraction of the city of Troitsk. </p><p>  The building of the Bashkirov Hotel is another historical building that was erected in 1909.  It is interesting that G. A. Bashkirov built the building because of a dispute with merchants at a fair in another city.  Now the hotel is operating for its intended purpose.  Address: st.  Klimova, 9. </p><h2>  Interesting monuments of the city </h2>

    <p>  The city is unique in terms of religious architecture.  It contains many historical monuments of Christian and Muslim culture, for example, on the street.  Lenin, 117, stands the Gataulla Mullah Mosque, erected at the end of the 19th century.  At one time, this building was the largest Muslim mosque in the Urals and Western Siberia.  In the 20th century, the building passed from hand to hand, and only in 2009, after restoration, began to operate for its intended purpose. </p><p>  The first Christian cathedral was built shortly after the founding of the defensive fortress in 1762 and became the first stone structure.  Almost in its original form, it has survived to the present day, although the building survived several fires, the placement of civilian objects in Soviet times and complete desolation.  Now the cathedral operates after reconstruction, you can visit it at the address: st.  Krasnogvardeiskaya, 1. </p><p>  Thus, the sights of the Troitsk Chelyabinsk region is a godsend for architecture lovers of the 18-20th centuries.  The infrastructure of the city has all the necessary benefits for a good rest, so any guest will be satisfied with their trip. </p>
