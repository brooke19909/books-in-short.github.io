  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make flowers from paper: schemes, templates, master classes for beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To create any beautiful card you will need the ability to make flowers from different types of materials.  There are simple options that even children can handle, but there are complex ones that consist of several stages of manufacturing.  Any material can be used - fabric and satin ribbons, felt sheets.  How to make flowers out of paper so that they turn out beautiful, neat and effective, read on in the article. </p><p>  The technique for making each type of crafts is different.  Consider the easiest ways for those masters who only try their hand at this art form.  Flowers made of paper for beginners are made according to schemes and patterns.  Looking at the photos, it’s possible to use a step-by-step explanation to easily assemble a flower from either a single piece of paper using the origami method or from individual petals. </p><h2>  Striped Sunflowers </h2><p>  Such light flowers from paper can be made even by preschoolers.  Each flower is made up of thinly cut strips of yellow double-sided paper.  They add up with the intersection at a central point, like a sun.  You need to distribute the petals at an equal distance, the more there are, the more magnificent the sunflower will be.  A black circle is glued in the middle.  Marker draws vertical and horizontal lines on it.  These are sunflower seeds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stripe sunflowers" class="if uuid-2353474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2353474.jpg"></div><p>  Similarly, work is being done on the remaining colors.  Then, cocktail tubes are installed that act as stems.  It remains to draw a vase on a white cardboard and cut it along the contours.  It is not glued completely, but only along the edges.  It turns out the effect of a three-dimensional image.  You already know how to make flowers out of paper in an easy way; now we will consider more complex options. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hyacinths </h2><p>  A very original bouquet can be made of double-sided colored paper in bright colors.  Sticks for stems can be made from a variety of materials - plastic tubes, wooden skewers or simple straight twigs.  They will not be visible, since they are wrapped in green paper.  How to make flowers from paper? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ccpl.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper hyacinths" class="if uuid-2353411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2353411.jpg"></div><p>  First, a long strip of purple, white or pink is cut.  Then one side is cut into a wide “noodle” and twisted up with a pencil. </p><p>  Then a stick is taken and the top is attached to the PVA glue.  Then they begin to wind the strip around in a spiral.  The bottom edge is also firmly attached.  Then the stem is wrapped in green paper, and the leaves are glued.  If you make several such light flowers from paper, you get a lush and beautiful bouquet, as in the photo above. </p><h2>  Stripe Patterns </h2><p>  In the photo below, you can see several types of cutting strips of paper.  You can use double-sided color or corrugated paper.  How to make flowers from paper?  First cut a strip of paper.  The width is taken different.  The wider the strip, the longer the petals.  The longer the strip, the more magnificent the flower is. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.blogdolusu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="strip patterns" class="if uuid-2353490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2353490.jpg"></div><p>  The shape of the petal depends on the method of cutting the edges with scissors.  You can make them round, wide or narrow, or you can cut into sharp corners.  After preparing the strips, take a base, for example, a toothpick, and begin to wind the paper around it.  The movements are carried out with tension so that all the turns are tightly in contact with each other.  Such flowers from paper according to schemes (patterns) can be made from corrugated paper with various centers.  Looks beautiful flowers made up of several shades.  To create such a multi-color bouquet, you need to glue paper of a different color after the strip of one color ends.  After attaching, winding continues again.  So you can add several shades of the same color.  For example, start with white, add pink, then raspberry, finish with maroon.  And the middle of the flower itself can be made of twisted stripes with small “noodles”.  Better to take a narrower strip. </p><h2>  Aster </h2><p>  A master class of large flowers made of paper will help to create a beautiful magnificent craft, as in the photo.  Make it from crepe paper.  For the middle, you need to take a narrow bright yellow strip and cut it as often as possible so that the "noodles" are thin and thick.  Wrap it on a thin stick or toothpick.  The edge is attached with PVA glue to the last turn.  Then the same manipulation is also made with a yellow stripe, only the width is taken more.  It turns out a magnificent middle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper aster" class="if uuid-2353461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2353461.jpg"></div><p>  Further work continues on the flower itself.  <span>Crepe paper flower</span> petals <span>are</span> long and pointed.  Therefore, a strip of cream paper is cut into long and sharp corners.  If desired, each can be rounded with a round pencil.  It is applied to the petal and lightly pressed with two fingers.  <span>Crepe paper flowers</span> will turn out to be large if you make each of several glued strips.  Since a real aster in nature is large, then a flower from paper should be made magnificent. </p><h2>  Petal patterns </h2><p>  The photo below shows the diagrams of the main options for making templates for the petals.  There is a technique for making volumetric colors collected from individual elements.  Using the sample in the article, draw some large details, the same amount of medium and small size.  Then the flower itself is composed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="petal patterns" class="if uuid-2353484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2353484.jpg"></div><p>  The petals are attached to the prepared center (described previously by the method of twisting the paper), spreading around the entire circumference of the cylinder.  Start with the smallest elements, the second row is created from medium sized petals.  The work ends by attaching the largest parts.  You can make them of one or different colors.  It all depends on the desire of the master.  Consider the example of a beautiful flower of petals consisting of two layers of paper. </p><h2>  Two-tone flower </h2><p>  To make such a beautiful flower out of paper, read the step-by-step instructions later in the article.  You will need double-sided white and purple paper. </p><p>  Instruction: </p><p>  Step number 1.  First, the middle is made of chopped "noodles" thin strips. </p><p>  Step number 2.  Another part is glued onto the prepared cylinder, only it is already purple.  Make it loops.  To do this, cut a wide strip of paper, fold in half and finely cut.  Then you do not need to deploy the part, and you need to double it in the middle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two-color flower" class="if uuid-2353480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2353480.jpg"></div><p>  Step number 3.  When the base for the petals is prepared, work continues on the manufacture of the flower itself.  Petals are cut according to the pattern.  Purple details make a couple of millimeters more white. </p><p>  Step number 4.  When pairs of petals are prepared, they begin to attach to the central cylinder from twisted strips.  Place them around the perimeter.  You can place them side by side, but you can overlap.  It all depends on the desire of the master.  The flower turns out to be bright and very effective, although it is not difficult to make it. </p><h2>  Roses </h2><p>  Flowers made of paper made from individual petals can be different.  These are asters, chamomiles, dahlias, marigolds, etc. Now we will consider in more detail how you can make a rose beloved by many on your own.  As in many other options, the middle is done first.  The manufacturing method is described in detail previously.  We will not repeat ourselves, just add that the strip is taken thin, and the "noodles" are cut into small and thick. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesitsgirls.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="big rose made of paper" class="if uuid-2353449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2353449.jpg"></div><p>  The photo shows what pattern the rose petals are cut out.  When many details have been prepared, pasting begins around the middle.  Work is carried out in layers, with an offset to the middle of the petal.  After that, each element needs to be twisted a little using a round stick.  An ordinary pencil will do.  So, the master class of large flowers made of paper is described, you can try to create them yourself. </p><h2>  Making cones </h2><p>  One of the beautiful elements in creating a flower is twisting the cones.  Some craftsmen use commercially available small square leaflets with a sticky adhesive strip.  The main thing is to choose the paper of the desired shade.  If you don’t have one, then the preliminary work is to cut square elements.  There must be a lot of them to make a large and magnificent flower.  However, often such elements are partially used in the flower, as one of the constituent elements. </p><p>  Each square is twisted into a cone.  The sharp corner is not cut, it also serves as a decorative element.  Consider an example of how such details can be included in the composition of the flower. </p><h2>  Flower with cones made of squares </h2><p>  In this article, several techniques described earlier are used at once.  These are twisted strips folded in half, and petals cut according to the patterns, and the cones described earlier.  Work begins as usual, from the middle.  To make it stand out against the general background, other contrasting colors are used.  These are pink, beige and blue stripes, which were first folded in half and then made many cuts, but not completely.  Leave about 1 cm to twist the strip into a skein. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful flower" class="if uuid-2353468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2353468.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see in the photo, some layers of loops are located exactly up, while others are slightly flattened.  To achieve this effect, after cutting the paper "noodles" you need to slightly move the remaining strips relative to each other.  Depending on the shear length, the loops change their shape, from vertically arranged to elongated. </p><p>  Then a lot of cones are created.  They are glued over a sharp edge to the middle in several layers.  The flower ends with six large petals.  They are cut according to the drawn pattern.  Bottom crafts can be glued on a tight circle of cardboard. </p><h2>  Origami flower pattern made of paper </h2><p>  Today, almost everyone on earth knows the ancient art of origami.  This is a paper folding method for different shapes.  Masters and flowers did not ignore.  In the photo below there is a paper origami flower scheme. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.learnatwork.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami folding pattern" class="if uuid-2353438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2353438.jpg"></div><p>  Each petal is made separately from a square of paper by folding.  The folds are performed carefully, each well smoothed with a finger.  After several petals are assembled according to the scheme, they are collected together, with an "accordion" inside.  Petals can be the same color, or you can collect a flower from colorful parts.  Get a fabulous flower-seven-flower. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  As you can see from the text of the article, it’s easy to make beautiful, voluminous flowers with your own hands.  The main thing is not to be afraid to try.  Start with the simplest manufacturing options and progressively improve.  If you wish, you can make any card, gift wrapping, album cover with photos.  If you learn how to create volumetric flowers, you can decorate the wall panel, decorate the interior of the apartment, decorate the walls or doors. </p>
