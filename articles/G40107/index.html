The city was founded in time immemorial, in 1221.  Over such a long history, many monuments of history, architecture and culture have been built here, and many of them have survived to this day, and in excellent condition.  This gave UNESCO grounds to include this city in the list of 100 cities of the world that are of cultural and historical value.  Moreover, its peculiarity lies in the fact that it is located in a very convenient place: it is very easy to get to the city by water, and a rare cruise bypasses it.  At the same time, tourists should stay somewhere, so the hotels of the city are also never empty and are very popular among guests.  A special place among them is the Marins Park Hotel (Nizhny Novgorod). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel marins park nizhny novgorod" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1040407.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The last in this class I want to note the triple "standard".  It differs from previous rooms only in that it has three single beds.  By the way, at a price it does not differ from the previous ones, which makes it very convenient for families.  The cost of rest per each family member becomes more than attractive. </p><h2>  Superior rooms </h2><p>  Marins Park (hotel, Nizhny Novgorod) offers guests rooms that differ primarily in their interiors.  Strict classics of rooms are replaced by a more refined design of superior rooms.  At the same time, tourists for whom it is important to save money will be happy to choose the first option, and those who care about the details will prefer the second.  In addition, single beds are replaced with double beds.  Otherwise, the equipment of the rooms remains unchanged, so we will not list it again.  The cost of rest is 3135 rubles.  without food and 3600 rubles.  with breakfast included. </p><h2>  Business rooms </h2><p>  For business guests, the hotel makes an even more interesting offer.  Single or double, business class rooms include a large comfortable bed with bedside tables, a TV and other necessary furniture and appliances.  In addition, for the convenience of guests, a modern warning system is arranged here, which informs staff about the status of the room: ‚Äúguest in the room‚Äù, ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù, ‚Äúcleaning is required‚Äù.  The apartments have a safe for storing valuables and papers.  The cost is 3610 rubles.  without food and 4100 rubles.  with breakfast included.  The interior of the rooms is different from those listed previously, which you will be notified about before making your final choice.  If he does not like you, then you can consider the options for individual rooms, which are each made in its own, sophisticated and sophisticated style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marins park hotel staff reviews nizhny novgorod" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1040411.jpg" width="500"></div>
