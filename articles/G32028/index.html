For participation in such a bright and at the same time tragic event, soldiers could not but be awarded.  Thus, the medal "For the Defense of Stalingrad" was introduced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-820357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33110/820357.jpg?1549746840"></div><h2>  Battle of stalingrad </h2><p>  The medal was awarded to Soviet soldiers who took part in the defense of the city of Stalingrad in 1942-1943 and showed unbending stamina and courage when fighting the enemy.  In the summer of 1942, a huge group of fascist troops approached the city.  About 2800 thousand officers and ordinary soldiers, 3.5 thousand mortars, more than 1 thousand aircraft launched an assault on Stalingrad.  The German armies were opposed by 150 thousand Soviet soldiers who were armed with 400 tanks, 2000 guns and mortars, 730 aircraft. </p><p>  The first phase of the Battle of Stalingrad (July-November 1942) was more defensive than offensive.  The Soviet army held the onslaught of superior German troops, heroically fulfilling the order of July 28, 1942, ‚ÄúNot a step back!‚Äù  And indeed, Soviet soldiers held every meter of their native land.  During bloody defensive and street battles, the Germans lost more than 600 thousand people wounded and killed, many tanks and planes were also destroyed.  In the future, the losses of the Nazi troops only increased.  The Germans lost near Stalingrad virtually a quarter of the personnel who fought on the entire Soviet-German front (about 1.6 million people).  By the beginning of February 1943, the fascist group near Stalingrad was completely exhausted and virtually defeated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Establishment of the medal "For the Defense of Stalingrad" </h2><p>  The flame of battle still burned in the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãon the Volga,</span> and the country's top leadership was already considering rewarding the heroes.  Thus, in December 1942, a resolution was adopted on the establishment of the medal "For the Defense of Stalingrad."  The decoration of the award was developed by the artist N.I. Moskalev.  They planned to award the medal not only to the military, but also to civilians, so that all direct participants in the defense of Stalingrad were noted.  Moreover, over 15 thousand civilians of the city volunteered to join the militia, heroically defending their native land. </p><p>  Regarding military personnel: both officers and ordinary ordinary soldiers were awarded the medal.  The Medal "For the Defense of Stalingrad" did not divide the heroes of the defenders into naval and ground forces, all kinds of troops were awarded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-820353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33110/820353.jpg?1549746840"></div><h2>  Making a medal </h2><p>  Initially, it was planned to manufacture the award from <span>stainless steel,</span> but the decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of March 30, 1943 approved brass as the material for the implementation of the medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of Stalingrad‚Äù.  On the reverse side of the award was its serial number, which corresponded to the certificate number for the honorary award. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the award was made of brass in the shape of a small circle, the diameter of which was 32 mm.  The obverse of the medal depicted a detachment of fighters with weapons, against the background of the <span>red banner</span> on the left side of them, the outlines of flying aircraft and moving tanks are visible.  At the top of the coin is a <span>five-pointed star,</span> on top of which the inscription "FOR THE DEFENSE OF STALINGRAD" is applied.  The reverse of the award depicts a sickle and a hammer and the inscription "FOR OUR SOVIET HOMELAND." </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-820356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33110/820356.jpg?1549746840"></div><p>  The basis for fastening the medal is a pentagonal block.  The medal is attached to it with the help of an eyelet and a small ring.  The block itself is covered with an <span>olive-colored</span> moire ribbon <span>,</span> in the center of which is an elongated red strip.  The width of the strip is 2 mm, and the tape itself is 24 mm. </p><h2>  Awarded for the defense of Stalingrad </h2><p>  There were so many heroes who defended Stalingrad from the Nazi invaders that they could not only reward but also count all.  According to general information, 760 thousand people received the medal "For the Defense of Stalingrad."  The lists of those awarded in alphabetical or some other order were most likely not compiled.  But there is an opportunity to see awarding orders.  You can also, knowing the name and surname of the participant of the Second World War, find out what insignia he was awarded by the command.  According to these data, historians will learn in more detail about those awarded for the defense of Stalingrad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-820354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33110/820354.jpg?1549746840"></div><p>  It is known that the medal "For the Defense of Stalingrad" was the first to be received: the commander of the 64th Army, M. S. Shumilov, the chairman of the Stalingrad City Council, D. M. Pigalev, the chairman of the Stalingrad Executive Committee, I. F. Zimenko, the secretary of the party committee, I. I. Bondar .  And in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Great Victory, Stalingrad was awarded the title of a hero city and was awarded the Golden Star medal. </p><p>  The battle of Stalingrad went down in the history of the Second World War as a unique example of courage and heroism, and in this connection the medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of Stalingrad‚Äù was created. </p>
