History of the death penalty in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The death penalty</span> is the case when the law allows, as a punishment, to take the life of a person guilty of crimes.  Many historians are wondering whether the introduction of the death penalty and its further abandonment were correct.  On the one hand, according to well-known facts, more than 60% of criminals, once again free, repeat their actions and return to basics.  However, when was the death penalty abolished in Russia? </p><p>  Often, in developed countries, a special <span>trial</span> is held before the death sentence begins <span>,</span> during which the defendant‚Äôs participation and guilt will either be proved or his lawyer will completely refute the actions attributed to his client.  Only a representative of the law endowed with such duties is entitled to execute.  Otherwise, the process of executing the death sentence can rightfully be considered a murder, and the so-called executioner will be judged according to the current law. </p><h2>  History of the death penalty in Russia </h2><p>  Mortal punishment in Russia has been a common occurrence for many years.  Some historians believe that the original sources of the death penalty are the customs of the <span>blood feud of the</span> Eastern Slavs.  In turn, such revenge is one of the most ancient forms of manifestation of punishment and torture over people. </p><p>  The occurrence of such punishment is usually attributed to the beginning of the 5th century.  The very first mention of the introduction of the death penalty on the territory of the Old Russian State is considered to be the punishment that was invented by Prince Vladimir for robbery in 996. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The first in Russia who nevertheless decided on the step of abolishing the death sentence was Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavovich.  However, this was not a personal initiative of the prince.  According to historical data, church hierarchs urged him to decide on such an act.  Subsequently, the children of Prince Yaroslav canceled many years of blood feud, replacing it with a cash payment in an appropriate amount.  But some historians argue that it was the death penalty that punished state crimes. </p><p>  Over the following years, the right to take life either disappeared or returned.  Many may consider this punishment a mistake, while others fully support such a policy.  Is the <span>death penalty</span> abolished <span>in Russia?</span>  Of course, yes. </p><h2>  The death penalty is a consequence of serious crimes </h2><p>  The last death sentence was recorded on the territory of the Russian Federation in 1996.  The punishment itself, in accordance with the Criminal Code of Russia, was established and recommended for use only in the case of serious crimes.  Also, the accused was given the right to additional consideration of his case in court with the participation of specially selected <span>jurors.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This punishment was imposed on males aged 18 to 65 years.  The criminal code of the Russian Federation at that time provided for only 5 articles, the punishment of which was the death penalty.  These included crimes such as genocide, murder, attempt on the life of a police officer, public figure or representative of the law.  The only type of execution in the Russian Federation was execution.  How and when was the death penalty abolished in Russia?  At the end of 2009, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation decided, on the basis of which there was a ban on the right to take the life of criminals. </p><h2>  The death penalty against women </h2><p>  According to the Constitution and the Criminal Code, it was strictly forbidden to apply such punishment to women, as well as to criminals who have not reached the age of majority.  As an exception, instead of a death <span>sentence, the court</span> could have appointed an imprisonment of 25 years or a <span>life sentence.</span> </p><h2>  Death sentence process </h2><p>  Until the death penalty was abolished in Russia, the law on the possibility of imposing the death penalty on people over the age of 18 was in force.  Also, the death penalty was not imposed on persons who were extradited by another country for prosecution and punishment.  According to the established rules, punishment was imposed only in the presence of a judge, prosecutor, defendant and his lawyer.  The execution itself was carried out under the judge who sentenced this sentence; a doctor must also be present to record the time of death, and an employee of the institution where the execution was carried out. </p>

    <h2>  Why Russia abolished the death penalty </h2><p>  Russia signed Protocol No. 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which states that no one may be sentenced to death in peacetime.  At the moment, there are several nuances and issues regarding the abolition of punishment and changes in the composition of the Constitution. </p>
