Our consumer is used to watching such a luxury only on the screens, so the excitement was grandiose.  Similar structures began to be erected in resort areas and rich regions.  Until recently, residents of central Russia could only afford water activities in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but in 2015 the long-awaited opening of the water park in Kstovo in the Nizhny Novgorod Region took place. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Information about the construction of a new facility appeared back in 2013, when the ceremonial laying of the capsule in the future foundation of the building took place.  The initial budget was about 800 million rubles, but, as always in our country, the amount was constantly increasing and supplemented.  Many people no longer hoped for a happy completion of the water park project in Kstovo. </p>

    <p>  The construction site was not chosen by chance.  In Nizhny Novgorod itself there are no water parks, as the city has few free sites for such a large-scale construction.  30 km from the regional center there is a small town of Kstovo with a population of 70 thousand people, and it is not difficult to get to it.  In addition, this construction was a good incentive for the development of local infrastructure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially, the date of the opening of the water park in Kstovo was called the end of 2014, but internal work was somewhat delayed, so the first visitors appeared here closer to the spring of 2015.  The water park received the sonorous name "Atoll".  According to the designers, the equipment and comfort are fully consistent with European standards, so the park can compete with Kazan or some Moscow water entertainment centers. </p><h2>  Opening </h2><p>  The first photos from the opening of the water park in Kstovo appeared in February 2015.  The organizers and builders of the project noted that the new facility is the first link in a series of large-scale construction of an entertainment zone in the Nizhny Novgorod region.  Its appearance is connected, first of all, with the upcoming 2018 World Cup. </p>

    <p>  The long-awaited opening took place <span>on February 7.</span>  Outside, frost and blizzards, but here tropical heat, water and all kinds of attractions.  But the first day did not live up to the expectations of the organizers - only about 200 people came to the water park.  The people were outraged by exorbitant prices, especially during the tough crisis in Russia.  So, an adult ticket cost 3 thousand rubles, more was only in water parks in Moscow.  The leaders soon realized their mistake, and prices fell slightly, as a result of which the flow of visitors increased markedly.  The photo from the opening of the water park in Kstovo, which visitors posted on their pages and in the official group, also contributed to raising interest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rides </h2><p>  During the construction and equipping of the water park, the authors of the project tried to meet international standards, since it is planned that foreign guests will also visit it.  At the opening of the water park in Kstovo, the management promised that the current state of the park is not the limit, and in the future it is planned to put additional attractions and recreation areas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="opening date of the water park in Kstovo" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45058/1822235.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  To date, the territory of the water park includes the following objects: </p><ul><li>  seven extreme and family slides; </li><li>  two pools for babies, one of which is made in the form of a large shower ‚ÄúChicken Tweety‚Äù and a hill ‚ÄúPumpkin‚Äù; </li><li>  there is a zone with a climbing wall; </li><li>  wave and hydromassage pools; </li><li>  jacuzzi; </li><li>  the bath complex includes a Russian, Finnish bath, as well as a hamam; </li><li>  Cafe; </li><li>  Spa; </li><li>  separate VIP area. </li></ul><p>  The opening of the water park in Kstovo was a real gift for residents of Nizhny Novgorod and neighboring regions.  In addition to basic services, birthdays and other children's parties are held here. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  All information on the work schedule, cost of visiting and other questions are on the official website of Atoll, as well as in the Vkontakte, Odnoklassniki and Instagram groups.  As noted above, the initial prices greatly angered the public, people in groups even created petitions, but the situation very soon changed in the opposite direction, and today a visit is available for the wallet of any family.  In addition, the management constantly holds all kinds of promotions, discount cards are practiced. </p>

    <p>  In addition, every weekend in the water park there is an animator for children.  Before visiting, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the rules of conduct on the premises. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  The opening of the water park in Kstovo was looking forward to several years.  In the harsh conditions of the Russian climate, the appearance of such a place is a real gift for both adults and children.  The first reviews were controversial.  Those who have never been to such institutions wrote about their enthusiasm and appreciation to the organizers.  More sophisticated people noted the low cost of attractions, the banality of the park.  Of course, the water park in Kstovo does not even reach the average American similar projects, which have a developed infrastructure and entertainment industry.  But for the average layman, a visit to the Atoll is a wonderful opportunity to relax, especially on frosty winter days. </p>
