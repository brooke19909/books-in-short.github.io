Description and diagrams of models will help each novice needlewoman to make for herself a fashionable and stylish novelty of the wardrobe. </p><p>  Initially, knitted cardigans were worn only by men.  Over time, women also fell in love with these clothes, and they began to successfully combine them with other wardrobe items.  In the women's wardrobe, these clothes appeared thanks to the famous Coco Chanel.  This clothing is enjoyed by both girls and adult women.  Among a wide variety, you can find models suitable for both slim and full women. </p><h2>  Cardigan History </h2><p>  Cardigan began its history with a man.  In 1854, during the Crimean War, British General James Cardigan added warm knitted button-down sweaters to his soldiers‚Äôs wardrobe.  They were without collars and worn under soldier's uniform.  These clothes reliably protected from winds and frost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple luxury cardigan. Double Rice Pattern" class="if uuid-2250015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2250015.jpg"></div><p>  The legendary Coco Chanel breathed new life into this forgotten men's clothing item.  In 1918, she created the first suit for women, which consisted of a skirt and a cropped black cardigan with patch pockets.  This innovation captivated the fairer sex.  Since then, cardigans have remained in the wardrobe of women and are still very popular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is needed </h2><p>  Of course, it is necessary to choose high-quality yarn, knitting needles, a pattern and buttons (if their use is necessary).  Yarn should be of high quality.  The general appearance of the product and your image as a whole depend on this.  Experts recommend giving preference to natural yarn (cotton, wool).  When choosing yarn, pay attention to the label.  On it, the manufacturer indicates the recommended size of the needles. </p><p>  It is better to study the scheme and knit a pattern in advance.  If you are satisfied with the result, you can start making calculations for the future product. </p><h2>  Variety of models </h2><p>  Tweed, knitted, knitted, silk - the variety of cardigans is staggering.  <span>This respectable</span> item of clothing has long gained popularity among women.

They allow each needlewoman to translate any idea into reality with her own hands, both for herself and for her beloved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mysekret.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warm knit cardigan" class="if uuid-2249992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2249992.jpg"></div><h2>  Combination </h2><p>  Having familiarized with the schemes and description, knitted cardigans with knitting needles can be made independently.  Such a cape will be indispensable in the offseason. </p><p>  Knitwear is always relevant.  They are practical, original and relevant at any time of the year.  The cardigan is so versatile that it can be combined with almost any clothing.

Such a wrap will go well with capri pants and leggings, a silhouette blouse and a long airy skirt. </p><p>  Sometimes a trivial t-shirt and beach shorts look great with a light cardigan. </p><p>  True fashionistas must have in their wardrobe a long cardigan with a large knit.  To create a unique look, they combine it with high-heeled sandals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mysekret.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted simple fashion cardigan" class="if uuid-2249993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2249993.jpg"></div><h2>  Cardigan Length </h2><p>  Deciding to make a knitted cardigan with knitting needles, diagrams and descriptions are not enough.
