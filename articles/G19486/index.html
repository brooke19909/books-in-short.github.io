    <h2>  <span>Educational loan</span> (state support) </h2><p>  This offer is valid for those citizens who want to receive funds for tuition at a university or any other educational institution.  At the same time, it is possible to pay up to 100% of the cost of the educational program, but the maximum loan amount is 1 million rubles. </p><p>  If we talk about the interest on the loan at Sberbank, then according to this program, the future student will need to pay 7.5% per annum.  Moreover, the loan term can be from 1 to 15 years or a period equal to the period of study.  If necessary, it can be increased by another 10 years.  The minimum loan amount must be equal to or greater than 10,000. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about the conditions of this loan at interest at Sberbank, the solvency of the borrower is not taken into account.  A pleasant surprise is that students receive a 3-month grace period after signing the contract. </p><h2>  Inappropriate loan (subject to real estate pledge) </h2><p>  This program implies rather low interest rates (from 12 to 13.5% per annum) and the absence of a commission.  In addition, consumers will not have to confirm the misuse of the loan.  When considering an application, each situation is studied privately.  Therefore, many seek to take out a loan at Sberbank.  Although interest is low, it‚Äôs worth considering that you have to fulfill several conditions. </p><p>  The minimum loan amount should be from 500 thousand to 10 million rubles.  In this case, the borrower must receive wages on the card of Sberbank.  Then the interest rate is reduced by 0.5%.  If a citizen insured life in a bank, then this value can be reduced by another 1%. </p>

If we talk about the maximum restrictions, then they are 72 years.  It is also necessary to confirm your solvency.  This means that you will have to bring a certificate of employment confirming that the borrower has been working in one company for at least six months. </p><p>  Continuing to consider the percentage of loans given to Sberbank, it is worth considering other loan options.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><h2>  Consumer loan (subject to the guarantee of an individual) </h2><p>  The main condition for this loan is the place of registration of borrowers.  If an individual receives a pension or salary through a specific branch of the bank, then they can apply for this program. </p><p>  According to the standard conditions for processing this type of loan, its minimum amount is 15 thousand rubles.  The maximum can be taken up to 5 million rubles.  If the borrower draws up a loan for a period of 3 months to 2 years and is not a client of Sberbank, the interest rate will be about 13.9-18.9% per annum.  When paying for a longer period (from 25 to 60 months), it will be increased to 14.9-19.9%. </p>

In this case, the annual percentage will be 13.5%, and the maximum loan amount will be equal to 1 million rubles. </p><p>  For comparison, it is worth considering a program that does not take into account state support.  In this case, the military will be forced to pay 14.5% per annum, provided that the maximum loan amount is half as much. </p><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that these conditions apply exclusively to NIS participants. </p><h2>  Consumer loan (refinancing) </h2><p>  In this case, the borrower, who has already taken credit obligations with any other bank, may apply to Sberbank in order to obtain a loan to pay for a third-party loan.  This program is very popular among consumers. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the percentage of the loan in Sberbank in this case, then it will be 13.9% if the loan term is not more than 1 year, and 14.9% subject to longer-term obligations (up to 5 years). </p><p>  However, in this case it will be necessary to confirm the intended use of the loan. </p><h2>  What interest does a loan at Sberbank give under a consumer loan program? </h2><p>  In this case, the citizen does not need to involve guarantors in the transaction or mortgage the property.  However, there are also subtleties here.  If the borrower is not a client of the bank, then he must pay from 14.9 to 19.9% ‚Äã‚Äãper year.  Moreover, a loan can be issued for a period of 3 months to 1 year.  If a citizen previously used the services of Sberbank, then with the same loan term he will pay 1% less. </p><p>  To obtain this loan, you need to confirm the performance and bring a certificate confirming that the borrower has been working in the same organization for at least six months. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth considering at what percentage a loan can be obtained at Sberbank if it comes to its own farm.  Today it is a very popular type of lending. </p><h2>  Credit to individuals (farm) </h2><p>  If the borrower owns his private household, he can receive certain subsidies from the state through Sberbank.  Thanks to this, he can count on the amount from 15 thousand to 1.5 million rubles for a period of 3-5 years.  If we talk about the interest rate, then in this case it will be 17% per annum. </p><p>  However, it is worth considering that this program provides loans up to 300 thousand rubles per farm, if the payment period is less than 2 years.  For those who plan to stretch payments up to 7 years, it is possible to obtain a loan of 700 thousand rubles for one farm. </p>

    <p>  In this case, you will have to take care of the availability of a guarantor.  Also, under the terms of this program, the age of the borrower was increased.  Today, the loan is available to those who are already 21 years old, but no more than 75 years old. </p><p>  From the foregoing, it becomes clear at what percentage of the loan at Sberbank you can get a loan for one or another need.  Nevertheless, it will be useful to clarify some of the subtleties of lending. </p><h2>  What determines the interest rate on loans </h2><p>  In banking, there is a single principle for the formation of interest rates.  First, there is a summation of the refinancing rate from the state and the profit of a particular banking organization.  This parameter is determined by the Bank of Russia.  Next, the permissible risks are calculated, which are added to the already existing amount. </p><p>  Quite often, the profit made by the bank is estimated at 5%, and the refinancing amount is about 8%.  Based on this, we get the usual 13%, which the bank's client pays during the year as a loan fee. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it is worth considering that this is considered an ideal calculation, under which the borrower makes payments without delay.  Then the interest rate will not fluctuate from year to year.  In fact, it turns out that the bank's customers arrange loans, but are in no hurry with payments.  Others regularly pay monthly payments.  But, despite this, the bank is forced to take into account the share of non-payment risk and to remove an additional percentage from more diligent payers.  Only in this case can balance be achieved. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about commercial credit organizations, they deliberately raise credit rates in order to obtain net profit and nothing more.  That is why before applying for a microloan, you should study everything several times.  Perhaps it is easier and more profitable to collect the necessary paper and obtain a loan from a trusted bank than to get a pig in a poke. </p><h2>  Is it possible to reduce the interest on a loan at Sberbank </h2><p>  Of course, each borrower wants to pay his debt as quickly as possible and at the same time lose a minimum of funds.  Of course, it is impossible to completely exclude the interest overpayment, however there are some tips that will help to pay back the loan at the lowest rate. </p><ul><li>  <em>When receiving a stock loan.</em>  Banks constantly carry out various advertising campaigns, according to which the borrower can receive financial resources at the lowest annual overpayment.  Therefore, do not rush into choosing a credit institution, it is better to carefully study the market.  Large banks very often organize special programs for different segments of the population. </li><li>  <em>Given the status of the client.</em>  If a client of a bank receives a pension or salary through him, then he can take part in one of the programs related exclusively to card and account holders.  In this case, the period of use of bank offers and the credit history of the citizen will be taken into account. </li><li>  <em>When providing real estate</em> as evidence of solvency. </li></ul><h2>  In custody </h2><p>  Regardless of what interest they gave a loan to Sberbank, it is important to carefully study the loan agreement.  It is especially worthwhile to pay attention to items related to the maturity of debt.  Sometimes, in case of late payment, the bank may charge very large interest. </p><p>  It is also worthwhile to prepare all the necessary documents in advance.  Only relevant and true data can be provided.  Otherwise, you can not only not get a loan, but also get into the black list of credit organizations.  In this case, a second loan cannot be obtained at any bank. </p>
