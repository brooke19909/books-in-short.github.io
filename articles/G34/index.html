    <p>  In the totality of chemical reactions, there is a metabolism and energy, so necessary for the life of the body.  The main stages are distinguished here - this is preparatory and metabolism.  At the first, a substance entering the body through an alimentary route undergoes a chemical transformation and then enters the bloodstream and into the cells.  The second stage is metabolism - the compounds entering the cells also undergo chemical transformations. </p><p>  Metabolism and energy in the cell performs specific functions.  This is the extraction of energy from the environment and its transformation into high-energy compounds necessary to provide cells with energy needs.  During this process, the formation of intermediates occurs, which are the precursors of high molecular weight cellular components, as well as the synthesis of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and sugars.  In addition, this process is accompanied by the destruction and synthesis of special biomolecules.  In simpler terms, the most complex <span>substances of the organic</span> type degrade into simpler ones, and the body, spending energy on this transformation, synthesizes cellular components. </p><p>  Metabolism and energy allows the body to multiply and grow, preserves its structure and responds to environmental influences.  To understand its essence, it is necessary to take into account cellular energy identity.  The cell is isothermal, that is, all parts of the cells have approximately the same temperature.  Between themselves, various cells practically do not differ in pressure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Metabolism and energy is not only the basis of all vital processes, but it is one of the most important specific signs that distinguish living matter from dead matter.  All elements that naturally enter the body turn into the tissue‚Äôs own substances, and later on into the final products. </p><p>  The metabolism and energy is carried out not only in the cell, but also in the intercellular fluid, and the constancy of its composition is maintained by blood circulation.  During the passage of blood through the capillaries, the plasma is able to completely renew 40 times.  An important role in these processes is played by enzymes.  They act as <span>biological catalysts,</span> and also regulate metabolic pathways. </p><p>  Absolutely in all living organisms, regardless of their primitiveness or, conversely, complexity, the basis of all life is the metabolism and energy in the body.  It defines the entire life cycle, starting from birth, growth, aging and ending with death. </p><p>  Various processes take place in the body - this is the <span>exchange of proteins,</span> fats, water, mineral salts, carbohydrates.  They include <span>plastic exchange,</span> in which new structures and compounds are created that are characteristic of each organism.  The results of <span>biological oxidation</span> is the release of energy necessary for the life of the body, tissues and cells.  The initial products of <span>energy metabolism</span> are the formation of ammonia, a compound of sodium, chlorine, fluorine and carbon dioxide.  The metabolism and energy in the body ends with the stage of elimination of waste compounds from the body, in the implementation of which the blood, lungs, <span>sweat glands,</span> and urinary organs participate. </p><p>  The law of conservation of substances and energy is the theoretical basis for the most important method of studying a process such as metabolism and energy or establishing balance.  That is, the amount of energy and substances that enter and are released from the body in the form of heat and other end products of metabolism is determined.  To determine their total balance, knowledge of accurate chemical methods and ways of isolating various elements from the body is necessary.  The energy balance is determined by the caloric content of food substances and the amount of heat released, which can be measured and calculated. </p>
