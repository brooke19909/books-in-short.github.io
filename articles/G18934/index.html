    <p>  Khan's palace in Bakhchisarai was founded by Khan Sahib I Gerai.  The construction of the palace lasted from 1532 to 1551.  At the same time, each new khan improved the structure, rebuilt the old buildings and added new ones.  In 1736, the Khan's palace was completely burned during the war with Russia.  Khans Selyamet Gerai and Crimea Gerai restored it for a long time.  After the Crimean peninsula became part of Russia, the Ministry of the Interior worked in the Khan Palace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The museum was opened in this building in 1908.

    <ul><li>  Mangup-Kale, Bakhchisaray - the largest ancient city in the Crimea.  BC, Tauris lived in this area.  In the Middle Ages the city of Feodoro was located here, the capital of the principality.  It was perfectly protected from enemy attacks by natural conditions, so for a very long time no one could capture it.  However, the rest of the territory was not so well protected, so the Tatars managed to conquer part of the principality.  In the 13th century, the Principality of Mangup, even having lost part of the territory, continues to be a strong state.  In 1475, Mangup was besieged by the Turks for six months.  Only hunger and disease drove residents to capitulate.  The city was burned, and only after some time the fortress was rebuilt by the Turks.  The last residents left here after Crimea became part of Russia. </li><li>  Eski-Kermen, p.  Red Poppy was founded in the 6th century by Scythian-Sarmatians.  Casemate towers were carved right in the rocks.  In addition, in the event of a siege, a well of 70 cubic meters was cut down.  m of water.  The slopes of the cave city are literally indented by caves.  In total there are about 350. They were mainly used in the 12-13 centuries.  They arranged workshops and wineries, kept cattle.  The city had its own water supply made of pottery pipes.  In 1299, he was burned by Nogai.  The city was not restored anymore. </li><li>  Tepe-Kermen, Bakhchisaray - a city almost impregnable from the south-west side.  The plateau area is small, but at the same time there are 250 artificially created caves.  Some of them are monastery complexes.  Tepe-Kermen ceased to exist at the end of the 14th century, as it was destroyed by the forces of Tamerlane. </li><li>  Kachi-Kalon, s.  Primal is located on a rock massif on the banks of the Kachi River.  In the Middle Ages, a rural settlement was located here.  Its creation was served by two convenient natural grottoes.  In the 9th century, a monastery was created in a large grotto with a spring, which was later destroyed by the Tatar-Mongols. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mangup Kale Bakhchisaray" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45767/1607958.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Bakhchisaray historical and cultural reserve is an interesting sight of Crimea.
