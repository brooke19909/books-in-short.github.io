    <p>  Lovers of church architecture will love the views of the Annunciation Cathedral, the Alekseevo-Akatov Monastery, the Assumption Church and other examples of the spiritual heritage of Voronezh.  You can relax in nature in the city center by glancing at <span>Petrovsky Square,</span> where the unique sundial is located - and it really works!  The shadow of the sun shows the time on them to the nearest minute.  Also here is the largest fountain of Voronezh.  It is highlighted at night, due to which a bizarre pattern is formed, and you can watch this game of colors endlessly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tales of Lipetsk </h2><p>  <span>The main asset of this city are healing mineral waters.</span>  <span>There is even an entertaining legend about this, in which the Lipans talk about how Peter I visited the Lipetsk factories, and after the visit, according to a long Russian tradition, he celebrated his arrival with the factory workers.</span>  <span>And he felt so bad in the morning, but he drank the water that the workers brought him, and he became much better.</span>  <span>After this incident, the emperor ordered the extraction of mineral waters in Lipetsk.</span> </p><h2>  City named after Peter I </h2><p>  <span>The monument to Peter I, which stands on the eponymous square, is considered the symbol of Lipetsk.</span>  <span>The monument is quite monumental, Peter is depicted somewhat boldly, he confidently steps forward, and this sight catches the eye.</span>  <span>Also in the city there are many fountains that are illuminated in the evening, creating a truly fabulous atmosphere.</span>  <span>The Komsomol pond is similar to all classical ponds in other cities, where people feed ducks and relax in the lap of nature, but here they are struck by the geometric shapes of the pond, which, it would seem, do not combine with the general look of Lipetsk, but still carry a beautiful urban culture.</span> </p>
