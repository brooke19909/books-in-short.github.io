Not surprising, because these products look so complex, beautiful, lush.  It seems that weaving such a tree is a laborious process: each leaf, each twig needs to be assembled from small beads onto a thin wire.  Yes, it will take a lot of time to weave a tree, but it is not as difficult as it seems.  We will be happy to share simple workshops for beginners with you. </p><h2>  Willow </h2><p>  A tree of beads on a window, table or on a shelf diversifies your interior and will delight you with its brightness.  We begin our acquaintance with beading of trees for beginners with weaving of willow.  This is the simplest, but very beautiful tree. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sinisaart.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A simple workshop for beading trees" class="if uuid-2517748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2517748.jpg"></div><p>  To weave a spreading, lush weeping willow, we need: </p><ul><li>  green beads of a light shade; </li><li>  thin wire with a diameter of 0.2 mm for weaving twigs; </li><li>  thick wire 1.5-2 mm for the formation of large branches and trunk; </li><li>  threads for sewing, iris or floss, gray-brown color for winding wire; </li><li>  the pot in which we will plant the willow, and a filler, such as small pebbles, as well as clay. </li></ul><h2>  Twig weaving </h2><p>  The process of creating twigs is very simple.  We measure out a piece of thin wire 70 cm long, pick up 14 green beads and place it in the center.  Next, from beads strung on a wire, make a loop and twist in 5-6 turns.  The resulting loop will be a leaf. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Weeping Willow Bead" class="if uuid-2517757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2517757.jpg"></div><p>  Next, we need to create more leaves from the remaining wire.  At one end of the wire, let us take the other one to the side for now, we need to pick up another 14 beads and place 1.5 cm from the finished leaf.  Fold the beads in a loop again, thereby forming another leaf.  After 5-6 turns, your end of the wire will return to the middle.  Repeat the same action with the second end. </p><p>  Did you do it?  Wonderful!  Having connected the two ends together, make 5-6 turns, again disconnect the wire and form the leaves. </p><p>  Thus, you need to create 15 leaves.  7 on each side and 1 on top. </p><h2>  Branch Formation </h2><p>  After the twig is woven, it needs to be shaped.  Extend the leaves, make them oblong, like a willow, and then send the leaves up to the central leaf, giving the shape of an ear.  The leaves should fit snugly together. </p><p>  Such branches need 48 pieces.  The process is monotonous and tiring, so feel free to include your favorite series and weave the branches of the future willow from beads together with your favorite characters. </p><p>  When the twigs are woven, you can begin assembling the tree.  Take 4 branches and twist them together, forming a sprawling branch.  Do not pile and twist everything, but add the part to the part gradually to get a beautiful, lush branch.  Thus, you should get 12 branches. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wood assembly </h2><p>  Now take a thick wire and wrap it with a long twig.  Immediately wrap each branch with a thin layer of thread, but so that the wire is not too visible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diy-is-fun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Neat little tree work." class="if uuid-2517751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2517751.jpg"></div><p>  We take three branches and weave them together in the same way as we formed in the previous stage, placing them at different levels.  To connect the branches, use pieces of wire and mask them with threads. </p><p>  From 12 thin branches, we got 4 lush, spreading branches, which we put together and tightly wrap a piece of wire, which we mask with a gray-brown thread. </p><p>  The next step involves planting a tree in a pot.  At the bottom of the pot we place something heavy, such as a handful of coins or a stone.  This will help the structure to withstand, as it is very light in itself.  Put the tree exactly up and fill the space with plasticine.  This is necessary in order for the plant to stay in the pot, to stand exactly in it.  Plasticine must be masked, for this we will need small pebbles and beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Beauty, as if real." class="if uuid-2517753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2517753.jpg"></div><p>  It remains only to spread the branches, giving them the necessary shape, like a weeping willow, and find a place in the house where you can put the craft. </p><p>  As you can see, step-by-step beadwork of a tree is very simple and requires only time and perseverance.  However, it‚Äôs worth it, the willow, although it just weaves, but it looks very beautiful and complex. </p><p>  We got acquainted with the simplest workshop on beading of trees, time to start a more complex version. </p><h2>  Beaded Bonsai </h2><p>  Japan is a country of incredible landscapes, and they came up with it to recreate miniatures of wonderful trees.  Bonsai translated from Japanese "dwarf tree growing on a pallet or in a low pot."  Once the cultivation of bonsai was an occupation of Japanese aristocrats, and now we are free to create our own lush green tree from beads. </p><p>  Look at how beautiful the tree made using the beadwork technique looks in the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What a performance!" class="if uuid-2517762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2517762.jpg"></div><p>  For this craft, we need: </p><ul><li>  beads; </li><li>  wire 0.35 mmm; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  Super glue; </li><li>  alabaster; </li><li>  colored stones and other elements for decoration. </li></ul><h2>  Bonsai tree foliage </h2><p>  To get started, to make your bonsai bright, mix a few similar shades of beads so that the foliage of your craft seems to shimmer.  To create a leaf, measure 45 cm of wire and thread 8 beads with it.  Twist the wire into a loop, making one revolution, put another 8 beads on one end and twist again.  So using two ends, make 8 stitches.  Make a bud from the stitches, twisting them all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Fantastic work!" class="if uuid-2517765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2517765.jpg"></div><h2>  Twigs </h2><p>  Bonsai in the usual view is a lush tree, so to create it you will need a lot of buds, with a total score of 150. After making the right amount, let's proceed to the formation.  3 buds must be combined in one bunch, loosely pressing them to each other.  Leave a couple of millimeters from the beginning of the bud.  These are small twigs.  Of them we need to form larger ones. </p><p>  Combine the three beams together, also backing off the distance, but by a centimeter.  Try to place one bunch above another so that the tree is more natural.  After twisting them together, wrap the wire with threads, it will mask the irregularities of the wire and give a more presentable appearance to the tree. </p><p>  Make the next twig from two bundles, twisting them with a 12 cm long wire. Also wrap with thread.  Create bundles of different sizes from 6, 7, 8 branches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple bonsai, but how beautiful." class="if uuid-2517759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2517759.jpg"></div><p>  Finished branches must be connected to a tree.  To do this, take a wire with a diameter of 3 mm and gradually, at different levels, attach the branches from the smallest to the largest.  Wrap the entire trunk with a thread and bend, giving the tree a natural shape. </p><h2>  Decor and stand </h2><p>  It remains to decorate the barrel and make a stand.  Mix water with alabaster, pour it into a mold that will serve as a stand, and set aside to dry.  The trunk of the tree also needs to be coated with a mixture on top of the threads.  To make the tree look as natural as possible, take a needle or a toothpick and make small grooves that will imitate the bark of a tree. </p><p>  After drying, cover the barrel with acrylic paint and paint the stand.  Using superglue or silicone glue, fix the tree to the stand and decorate with stones or additional figures.  Stones will help to cope with the balance of crafts, go to their location wisely. </p><p>  Here is such a wonderful beadwork tree we can offer you.  Bright bonsai can be a pleasant gift for someone.  A small, neat, like a living tree will appeal to friends and family. </p><div class="photo" data-original="500px.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nice home decor." class="if uuid-2517761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2517761.jpg"></div><p>  We hope you enjoyed our workshop on tree beading.  Weaving from beads takes time, but it is so nice to look at the result of this painstaking work.  Beadwork of trees and flowers is a fascinating activity that brings excellent results - you have a beautiful home decoration, as well as an excellent DIY gift for someone from your loved ones. </p><p>  Create and create, be your own designers and make unique jewelry for yourself and your loved ones. </p>
