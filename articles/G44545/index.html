The tiny principality, intended for idle pastime, is closely connected with the world of luxury and glamor.  This is a favorite vacation spot of all the rich and famous, rushing here to soak up the Cote d'Azur, become the owner of a major casino win and conclude billions of dollars in transactions. </p><p>  Monte Carlo, synonymous with wealth, luxury, bright sunshine and gambling, is the unofficial name for the capital of the micro-power, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly two square kilometers. </p><h2>  Holiday atmosphere </h2><p>  It is believed that life in an elite corner means some kind of involvement in the world of the upper world hidden from the views of outside observers.  Enthusiastic guests leave for the heart of the fabulously beautiful Monaco - Monte Carlo, whose attractions evoke mixed feelings: from envy to admiration. </p>

    <p>  The atmosphere of a constant holiday, stunning nature and the amazing beauty of architectural monuments provide a small state with an endless stream of tourists.  It is noteworthy that the principality, in which no more than 30 thousand people live, is visited by five million travelers annually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The world of luxury and glamor </h2><p>  Guests of the city do not hesitate to confess their love to the beautiful Monte Carlo.  Sightseeing (tourist reviews only confirm this) is a wonderful reason to get to know the sunny resort more closely.  An oasis of comfort and flaunting wealth attracts everyone who wants to be elected for at least a few days. </p><h2>  Casino is a symbol of the city </h2><p>  Locals say that one day you can explore the main city of Monaco - Monte Carlo.  Sights that have brought unprecedented fame to the world gambling capital are considered its symbols.  As you know, the elite region of the Principality owes its appearance to an enterprising merchant who built a small casino with gaming machines and office space.  The incredible popularity of this place simply went wild, and the organizers kept expanding the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe building, which was subsequently set on fire by one of the losers. </p>

    <p>  But the second casino at Place du Casino was erected by the famous architect S. Garnier, who created many architectural masterpieces.  A real palace with magnificent halls appeared, and the second part of the magnificent structure belongs to the Opera House of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Casino de Paris, at first glance, is open to all comers.  Tourists who do not plan to try their luck while in Monte Carlo can enter the hall with gaming devices for free. </p><p>  Attractions, whose halls are decorated in the style of past eras, attract avid players from around the world.  To get to the premises where the main action takes place, you will have to pay ten euros.  But nobody will be able to get into the main hall, because only the privileged audience is allowed into the VIP rooms of the main object of the capital of the state. </p><h2>  <span>Green areas</span> giving peace </h2><p>  Around the casino there are wonderful French gardens with exotic plants, and from the side of the turquoise sea there are sun-drenched terraces.  Monte Carlo, whose attractions have made the city look unforgettable, is famous for its beautiful green areas - great places for finding harmony. </p><p>  The Japanese Garden became the real work of <span>landscape architecture</span> , created so that residents and visitors of the city could fully enjoy the solitude with nature, get rid of problems and be in silence.  The picturesque area was laid out in memory of Grace Kelly at the behest of her husband, Prince Rainier III.  Everything in this breathing calm place is subordinated to the philosophy of Zen, leading a person to enlightenment.  The murmuring waterfalls, transparent ponds with fish, magnificent rock gardens, small houses seem to be saturated with Japanese symbolism. </p>

    <h2>  Royal Palace </h2><p>  After visiting the casino and finding peace in green areas, tourists go on to get acquainted with a small Monte Carlo.  All the sights of the city, of course, cannot be mentioned in one article, but it is impossible to pass by the grandiose structure that originally served as a defensive fortress. </p><p>  The current residence of the princely family, built on a 60-meter cliff, was home to Prince Rainier III of the Grimaldi dynasty and the beautiful Grace Kelly, who became the princess of Monaco.  The royal palace, surprisingly modest in appearance, is partially open to visitors.  A museum is located in one wing of the residence, and rulers of the state have lived in the other for over 700 years.  Tourists admire the rich interiors, covered with gilding, paintings of famous masters, luxurious carpets, bright frescoes. </p>

    <p>  In addition, travelers gather in the square in front of the palace, where a ceremonial change of the guard is held.  The regularly held ceremony remains for a long time in the memory of those who arrived in search of new experiences in the fabulous Monte Carlo.  Sights, photos of which can be found in every guide to Monaco, captivate with elegance and sophistication. </p><h2>  Oceanographic Museum </h2><p>  <span>The capital of Monaco</span> is called the treasury of ancient architectural objects that have a certain value for society.  Monte Carlo, whose attractions and cultural objects are of interest to tourists, is famous not only for casinos and comfortable hotels, but also for museums with unique exhibits.  All guests of the city consider it their duty to visit a true paradise for lovers of the underwater world. </p><p>  The Oceanographic Museum, founded by <span>Prince Albert</span> I, is visited annually by about one million people.  An architectural masterpiece that has grown in the rock rises above the city, and tourists traveling by ship, from afar see a snow-white building with a huge collection of underwater inhabitants.  All visitors are delighted with the real submarine at the entrance, on which the team of the famous traveler Cousteau explored the ocean. </p>
