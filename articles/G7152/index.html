It is built in a modern style, and the service is of a high standard. </p><h2>  Time zone Moscow - Dominican Republic </h2><p>  As a rule, many guests do not know how much time is in the Dominican Republic.  And therefore, when they call at the reception, they are surprised that no one is answering.  No wonder.  Indeed, between the Dominican Republic and Moscow, the time difference is as much as 7 hours, and calls are received only during business hours. </p><h2>  Address and Location </h2><p>  Royalton Punta Cana Resort is located at Playa Arena Gorda, Punta Cana 23000 Dominican Republic.  This is the east coast.  The nearest airports are Punta Cana (21.5 km) and La Romana (56.1 km). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itaka.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royalton punta cana 5 hotel" class="if uuid-3236859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/3236859.jpg"></div><p>  Royalton Punta Cana is close to several restaurants.  They prepare dishes of different cuisines of the world - Caribbean, Mexican, international, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc. So that every tourist will find a dish to his taste. </p><p>  In addition, close to the hotel a lot of entertainment.  The main ones are Escapology, where quests for different ages take place, and a large golf course (800 m from the hotel).  Tourists are not only interested, but also difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most incredible and famous entertainment is Bavaro Adventure Park, but it is located 16 km from the hotel.  Tourists really like this park.  After all, here everyone will find entertainment for themselves.  There are only 11 attractions in the park.  Among them are both active and passive.  Ticket price depends on the complexity and amount of entertainment. </p><h2>  Terms of Accommodation </h2><p>  Rooms at the Royalton Punta Cana 5 * hotel need to be booked in advance, as the place is quite popular and there will simply not be any rooms available at the right time. </p><p>  Check-in is allowed from 15:00 to 23:30.  And departure strictly 12: 00-12: 30.  You can live with children of any age.  Moreover, if a child under 12 years old does not sleep in a separate bed, then only 50% of the room price will be charged.  Extra beds are not available.  But pets are strictly prohibited, even a separate fee will not help. </p><p>  When booking 6 rooms or more, certain conditions apply and additional funds may be charged that are debited three business days after the reservation.  Therefore, it is important that the required amount is on the payment card. </p><h2>  Room Description of Royalton Punta Cana </h2><p>  The hotel has many rooms.  More simple but luxurious - Diamond Club.  Typically, these rooms have one large double bed and one sofa bed, which can accommodate a child up to about 12 years old.  Diamond Club apartments are the cheapest at the hotel. </p><p>  There are ocean view rooms with two large double beds and two regular double beds.  These apartments are a little more expensive than Diamond Club only because of the beautiful view from the window. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel also has several suites.  The apartment can have two large double beds or one extra large double bed.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãeach room is about 27 square meters.  m </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.royaltonpuntacanaresort.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel room royalton punta cana" class="if uuid-3236869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/3236869.jpg"></div><p>  A presidential number is also available.  It has 1 bedroom with two large double beds and a spa bath.  Presidential rooms are the most expensive, as they are more comfortable than in previous apartments. </p><p>  Each room has a TV with Russian channels, a bathroom with all necessary accessories, ironing board, iron, safe, minibar, air conditioning. </p><p>  As you can see, the number can be chosen to suit your interests.  The hotel provides everything for a good rest guests. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Prices range from 15 to 30 thousand rubles.  Depending on the specific room and number of people.  Of course, depending on what time of the year the tourists decided to come to rest in the Dominican Republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-3236877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/3236877.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the cost of rooms depends on the living conditions.  If there are additional benefits in the form of a hot tub, the price will be significantly higher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Tourists do not have to go for lunch or dinner somewhere outside the hotel.  After all, there are 4 restaurants on the territory: </p><ol><li>  Gourmet March√©.  The restaurant menu features international dishes.  It is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. </li><li>  Mexicana Cantina.  Only Mexican cuisine is prepared here.  Open only in the evening. </li><li>  Under the Sea International Cuisin.  Only seafood is prepared.  There is a restaurant in the evening. </li><li>  Zen  This is a Japanese restaurant where you can only dine.

The rest work only in the evening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Japanese restaurant at royalton punta cana" class="if uuid-3236871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/3236871.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, if you do not want to eat at the hotel, you can always find nearby restaurants and cafes that prepare equally delicious dishes.  You can even have a snack on the beach itself, but you need to be prepared for overpriced prices. </p><h2>  Service at Royalton Punta Cana </h2><p>  The hotel service is excellent.  The staff always makes concessions to guests and tries to help in resolving any issue.  As a rule, at the reception guests are offered a wide variety of services.  For example, guests can contact the tour desk to help you choose the right destination for your vacation.  Moreover, the hotel is responsible for the organization.  However, for a fee. </p><p>  The rooms are wet-cleaned daily.  At the same time, towels, bed linen.  However, if the client does not want to clean the room, this must be warned in advance. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The hotel tourists relaxed comfortably.  Indeed, in addition to restaurants on the territory there are many amenities.  For example, free Wi-Fi, a swimming pool, parking and a bar where you can spend the evening leisure.  There is even a room for spa treatments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The area at the royalton punta cana" class="if uuid-3236872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/3236872.jpg"></div><p>  For those guests who can not live without sports, there are gyms, a minigolf course, a fitness center. </p><p>  In addition, there is another fascinating entertainment in the form of a casino.  Everyone can try their luck. </p><p>  The hotel has a tour desk, which offers guests a variety of excursions and entertainment.  These are water sports, fishing tours, boat nights and much more.  For teens there is also entertainment - Hangout. </p><p>  For cash at the hotel there is an ATM and an exchange office.  Therefore, the financial problem by itself disappears. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Many tourists come to rest with children of different ages.  And not in vain.  Indeed, next to the Royalton Punta Cana 5 * hotel there are playgrounds.  And the hotel has all the conditions for relaxing with children.  Kids are allowed to swim in the pool with adults.  Yes, and the hotel has a mini water park for older children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.puntakana-dominikana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's water park at the hotel" class="if uuid-3236874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/3236874.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the Bavaro Adventure Park has fun with the whole family.  There is excellent staff service, a clean beach, a beautiful small water park, trains for kids, bungees for adult children, ATVs for teens. </p><p>  So, children of any age will enjoy this cozy park.  True, the weekend is very crowded and all the rides are too long queues. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel there is an additional service - babysitting for children.  The ticket price is not included, but paid separately. </p><p>  For adults there is a business room and a banquet room.  They are paid separately. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Of course, there are many different reviews, both good and bad.  However, there are significantly more positive ones.  The bulk of the guests say the hotel captivates with the cleanliness that is inherent in not every hotel.  However, many guests believe that in addition to cleanliness, excellent service.  The staff is very polite and helpful.  Any employee of the hotel can be approached on any issue.  In addition, many customers like the price / quality ratio. </p><p>  Still, there are dissatisfied guests who did not like the location of the room, as I would like the windows to face the ocean and not the terrace.  And in the pool, not everyone liked to swim with children.  Guests are asked by the property to ponder and make a separate children's pool.  While the wish of the guests has not been realized. </p>
