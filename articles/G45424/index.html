Especially located in the historical center of this magnificent city, striking in its beauty and grandeur.  Well, it‚Äôs quite possible to fulfill your dream thanks to the Tapiola residential complex put into operation in 2015.  Lemmink√§inen Rus, a construction company from Finland, has chosen an amazing place for its brainchild.  This is the Admiralteysky district of St. Petersburg, whose architecture is characterized mainly by pre-revolutionary buildings.  So everything here reminds of those days when young ladies in a crinoline walked slowly along the Neva embankment, and the brave officers of the <span>Semenovsky regiment</span> pranced on horses <span>.</span>  Living in such a place is true happiness for those who are truly in love with this beautiful city. </p><p>  "Tapriola" - LCD, which will provide such an opportunity to everyone.  True, the property offered here belongs to the comfort plus class, so the prices for it, for quite nice reasons, are appropriate.  However, it cannot be argued that the cost of apartments is so high that only those whose bank account has a significant number of desired zeros can afford it.  Everything is possible, especially if you don‚Äôt sweep over large areas. </p><p>  For our part, we will try to help potential buyers and describe in detail what the Tapiola residential complex is like.  Reviews of those who have already become the owner of the apartments in the complex will also be given in our review. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tapiola lcd" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1278005.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What can be said about the developer </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the project was created and implemented by a Finnish company that has long been operating in the real estate market of St. Petersburg.  The Lemmink√§inen Rus concern began its career in the 70s of the last century, successfully mastering the territories of the then existing Soviet Union.  Mostly in those days, the developer was engaged in the construction of road surfaces, as well as the construction of social infrastructure.  Since 2005, the developer has been operating in the housing segment. </p><p>  Each potential buyer before concluding a contract is strongly recommended to inquire about the reputation of the developer.  After all, to acquire real estate in order to avoid numerous problems can only be a reliable and respected developer.  This is exactly what the Lemmink√§inen concern is - the Finnish developer, who has been engaged in his activities for more than a hundred years in his homeland.  Such a long work experience cannot, of course, be discounted.  And the notorious Finnish quality is also a matter of respect.  In addition, Tapiola - LCD in the company‚Äôs assets is far from the only one, there are objects of the same plan that have already been commissioned for a long time, so you can get acquainted with the product, provide it with the company, and also get the opinion of people who use it in real life.  And the last one is that it is a reliable developer, renting out objects on time, not causing any complaints from the clients. </p><h2>  A few words about the complex </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the place of construction of the residential complex ‚ÄúTapiola‚Äù is <span>St. Petersburg, Admiralteysky</span> District.  Exclusive location, excellent reputation of the developer, comfortable apartments and a variety of choices make this offer very attractive for potential customers.  The project is fully completed, in November 2015, Tapiola 2 LCD was commissioned and commissioned.  Work began in 2012.  It was supposed to carry out construction in two phases.  The first, which included six buildings, as well as a kindergarten and underground parking, was commissioned at the end of 2014.  Almost all the apartments in these six sections are sold out.  Today, real estate is offered only in the second part of the residential complex ‚ÄúTapiola‚Äù.  Stage 2 was commissioned in 2015.  There are currently 418 unsold apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD tapiola St. Petersburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1278008.jpg" width="600"></div>

The address of the complex is the embankment of the Obvodny Canal, 8. The prestigious district, considered the historical center of St. Petersburg.  Not far from the complex - just one kilometer from it - is the Yusupov Garden and the Olympia Garden.  Three kilometers - St. Isaac's Cathedral, four - Kazan, the Neva Embankment, Palace Square and the Admiralty, as well as the Hermitage.  In general, almost all the world famous sights are nearby. </p><p>  And since this is a center, every lucky owner of an apartment in LCD Tapiola (St. Petersburg) can use the services of shopping and entertainment infrastructure at any time, of which there are a great many.  So we will not describe them in detail, since it will take a very long time.  As for the social infrastructure, everything is in order with it.  The residents of Tapiola residential complex will be fully provided with everything necessary.  St. Petersburg, as you know, is a big city, the second capital of Russia, so special attention is paid to its social development.  Next to the described complex there are seven kindergartens and 14 schools.  In addition, there is a private d / s, which is located on the ground floor of the house. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  And here everything is on top.  Five minutes walk - Frunzenskaya metro station, ten minutes - Baltiyskaya station.  Directly next to the <span>residential complex</span> there is a public transport stop with which almost every minute either a bus or a fixed-route taxi leaves.  As for the motorways serving the area, this is the embankment of the Obvodnoy Canal and Moskovsky Prospect.  So, getting from here to any district of the city will not be difficult.  In addition, nearby, literally 800 meters from the complex, is the Baltic Station.  A little further - Vitebsk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Tapiola 2" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1278004.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, all the reviews of residents available about LCD ‚ÄúTapiola‚Äù emphasize that the transport infrastructure of the district is at its best. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  What is the ecological situation in the area in which the Tapiola residential complex is located?  Feedback on this issue is sometimes confusing for potential buyers.  The fact is that under the Soviet Union this part of Leningrad was considered almost an industrial zone, since there were quite a lot of enterprises of this kind.  However, many of them ceased their activities after the collapse of the Union, some of which are bankrupt today, and therefore also do not function.  So, by and large, at the moment there are not so many of them.  Well, those that remained no longer cause such significant damage to the ecology of the region.  In addition, many green areas located next to the complex compensate for the harm they cause.  So we can say with confidence that Tapiola is a residential complex located in an area whose ecological status is quite acceptable. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  As we have already said, Tapiola is a residential complex in which comfort + class apartments are for sale.  And the choice is literally striking in its diversity.  The assortment of apartments is so huge that it‚Äôs not difficult to choose the perfect option for yourself.  And from the abundance of planning decisions, my eyes literally run up.  Buyers are offered both a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãa studio apartment and five-room two-level apartments in the Tapiola complex (LCD).  The ceiling height in the latter reaches three meters, which is very impressive to many.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments also varies markedly and ranges from 23 to 189 square meters.  Regardless of size, each living room has a dressing room, which is also popular with everyone who is considering buying a property in the complex we are describing.  Also, all apartments have large kitchens and bathrooms and are equipped with glazed balconies, loggias, spacious enough so that you can not only admire the scenery of St. Petersburg with them, but even put small-sized furniture for relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD tapiola address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1277998.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Finish </h2><p>  Since Tapiola is a residential complex built by a Finnish developer, the options for decorating apartments in it are noticeably different from Russian ones.  There are three of them.  This is the original white finish.  That is, all plastering works were carried out, the walls and ceiling are smooth and white.  All that remains to the owner is to make decorative repairs.  This option is perfect for people who want to create an interior design on their own, in accordance with their individual taste. </p><p>  Full decoration implies the presence in the apartments of already painted walls and <span>ceilings, laminate on the</span> floor, tiles in the kitchen and bathrooms.  In the latter, by the way, the corresponding furniture has already been installed.  There are interior doors, in addition, subject to an additional payment, the Smart Home system can be installed.  If the buyer has a desire, then the developer can complete the finish on an individual project.  A professional designer is also available. </p><p>  Finnish finishes are also available.  What is its difference?  The fact that the interior is used exclusively wood and glass.  Such apartments, by the way, decorated in the best Finnish traditions, are becoming increasingly popular today. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Naturally, the prices for apartments of the comfort + class cannot be a priori low.  Nevertheless, you can buy a studio apartment in the residential complex ‚ÄúTapiola‚Äù for five million rubles.  As for the apartments of two and three-room apartments, no information can be provided here, since all the premises have been sold.  There were only large areas of apartments, consisting of four and five rooms.  All of them are located in the residential complex "Tapiola 2".  As for the cost, it varies depending on the type of decoration chosen and ranges from 18 to 19 million rubles for four-room apartments, and from 22 to 25 million for five-room apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd tapiola reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1277997.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Inland </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the developer paid due attention to this issue.  It is assumed that the house will be located in a completely fenced area, and even guarded around the clock.  Everywhere - around the perimeter and at the entrances - CCTV cameras are installed.  Landscaping is being carried out, playgrounds are equipped, and small architectural forms are also installed.  There are comfortable walkways, there is also a car parking for guests.  There are also specially equipped places for outdoor sports. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do the residents who have already moved into luxury apartments say about Tapiola residential complex?  As a rule, there are few negative reviews.  And they relate to a greater degree to high cost.  But after all, by and large, and what, in fact, want?  The center of St. Petersburg, the house erected by a Finnish company, imported high-quality materials used for decoration ... You have to pay for all this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd tapiola reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1277995.jpg"></div>

    <p>  So there is nothing surprising in the fact that the cost of residential premises in Tapiola is somewhat different from that in houses from Russian developers.  However, the developer is doing everything possible to make apartments more affordable.  Promotions are constantly held, thanks to which you can often get significant discounts.  According to buyers, some managed to buy apartments 10-15% cheaper.  When converted to millions, you must admit that we get very significant savings. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the quality of construction and finishing works.  Everything is done in good faith.  Residents especially like the fact that the house has its own boiler room, which allows not only not to depend on the vagaries of communal services, but also to save on services.  Well, and the presence of a kindergarten in the house is completely beyond praise. </p><p>  Everyone is delighted with the large kitchens and dressing rooms.  The layout of the apartments is also pleasing. </p><p>  Residents also say that they like the fact that the elevators in the porches work quietly, and the presence of a concierge service in each porch allows you to feel safe and not be afraid of the intruder's intruders. </p><p>  In addition, residents praise the finish in the bathrooms and the non-stop drainage system, thanks to which there is a minimal number of pipes in the apartment.  Many people also like the fact that special ASO panels are installed in the bathrooms, thanks to which additional communications can be carried out without the gating process, which is accompanied by noise and dirt, and also requires subsequent finishing work. </p><p>  In general, by and large, everyone is happy with everything.  Of course, some doubts arise from the ecology of the region, but, frankly, what to expect from it if you live in a metropolis such as St. Petersburg.  It is unlikely that one can find places in it with the same environmental conditions as in a provincial small town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc tapiola lemmink√§inen" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1277994.jpg" width="599"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  "Tapiola" - LCD, which, of course, is worth attention when selecting real estate options.  Quality comfortable apartments located in a house erected in the center of St. Petersburg are worth the money that will have to be given to the buyer.  In addition, it is not necessary to discount the fact that they can be purchased directly from the developer, bypassing intermediaries.  And this is a significant savings.  Which is especially important when it comes to comfort class property. </p>
