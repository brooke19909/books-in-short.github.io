Seaside Park owns a spa center, which uses all modern technologies in the field of beauty and health. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><img itemprop="image" alt="kodak sudak" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56088/1946867.jpg" width="600"></p><p>  The small hotel building accommodates about 30 rooms of various categories, the cost of which starts from 10 thousand rubles per night.
