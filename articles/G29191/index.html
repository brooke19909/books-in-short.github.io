Travelers note that this place has a special atmosphere, for which I want to come again and again. </p><p>  The complex is located in close proximity to the main natural attractions of the city, for example, lakes, avenues of "thousand pines" and the cliffs of Rooster. </p><h2>  Provence </h2><p>  ‚ÄúA chic place to stay‚Äù - this is what they say about the Provence hotel.
