Everyone is looking forward to a long vacation and the moment when you can put a Christmas tree.  But to create a festive atmosphere, a Christmas tree is not enough.  New Year's decor is also garlands, glass and plastic balls, wreaths and candles.  The manufacture of all these holiday attributes will be discussed below. </p><h2>  Bouquet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year decor ideas" class="if uuid-2432245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2432245.jpg"></div><p>  The tree will stand in the middle or in the corner of the room, but what to put on the table?  As a Christmas decor, you can make a beautiful bouquet.  Such a composition will decorate the room and will cheer you up.  Styles of New Year's decor are different.  The most popular of them is eco-style.  It is in it that we will collect the bouquet.  To make crafts, you will need tree branches, spruce branches, cones, cotton, cinnamon sticks and dried orange slices.  We will collect a decorative composition from the base.  You need to cut the branches of the same length, and then glue them together so that a circle forms.  To make the bouquet more stable, you can glue the round cardboard box with sprigs.  Take pine or spruce branches, fill them with a container.  Now, in a chaotic manner, arrange cotton branches, cones in a box.  When the main decor is ready, use the hot gun to attach the dried orange slices and cinnamon sticks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wreath </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dekoking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="christmas wreath" class="if uuid-2431349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2431349.jpg"></div><p>  One of the recently appeared items of New Year's decor is a Christmas tree wreath.  Our compatriots (like Europeans) attach a wreath to the door.  But the Russians prefer to decorate the inner rather than the outer part of it.  A master class of New Year's decor is presented above.  It will be easy to collect such a wreath.  To make it, you will need paper, thread, spruce branches and a hot gun.  Take a newspaper or other unnecessary paper, roll it up with a tube.  Now fold the ring and fix it with a thread.  To create a wreath, you can use both real and artificial Christmas trees.  Cut the branches into small pieces.  Arrange spruce branches on a wreath in one direction.  It is better to attach them with a thread or wire, and if necessary, glue them with a hot gun.  When the wreath is ready, you can proceed to its decor.  To do this, use cones, dried orange slices, cinnamon sticks or Christmas toys.  Be sure to attach a ribbon or rope to the upper back of the wreath.  For it, a decorative product will be hung on the door. </p><h2>  Composition </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="christmas composition" class="if uuid-2431298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2431298.jpg"></div><p>  Do you want to make an original New Year's decor?  Compositions of fir branches do not really appeal to you?  Then create a beautiful decor from branches, polystyrene and garland.  Make preparations for the future product will need to be in the fall.  To search for suitable branches in the winter under the snow is an unpleasant pleasure.  Cut the found blanks so that they are all of different lengths.  But randomness must be strictly ordered.  Make sure that the branches form a beautiful pyramid, not a broom.  Take a piece of foam and disassemble it into its components.  Dip the branches in glue, and then powder them with foam.  In some places you can use coarse sea salt.  Take the garland and place it on the branches.  For this purpose, light lights are suitable.  New Year's composition should be placed in a high vase and placed on a table. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Christmas tree toy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree toy" class="if uuid-2431302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2431302.jpg"></div><p>  A beautifully decorated Christmas tree is the pride of any person.  And how pleasant is the process of decorating a green beauty.  <span>You</span> can buy <span>Christmas decorations</span> for decor not only in the store, but also make it yourself.  If you have free time, you can start producing a series of Christmas toys.  For their manufacture you will need fabric and synthetic winterizer.  Make a pattern, for example, a month.  Cut the two parts into a plain fabric stencil.  And why can‚Äôt you use print material?  Bright textures will interrupt the additional decor, which will subsequently decorate the product.  Sew the toy, stuff it.  Now you can start decorating.  For this purpose, you can use cones, fabric flowers, different badges, threads and beads. </p><h2>  Decorative christmas tree </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative tree" class="if uuid-2431304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2431304.jpg"></div><p>  Each has a different attitude to New Year's decorations.  Some hang them around the apartment in huge numbers, and for someone it is quite enough to put a few decorative elements.  The decorative tree will appeal to both the first and second type of people.  It is easy to make, and then you can use it from year to year.  How to make a decorative craft?  From wooden slats you need to make a triangular frame.  You can fasten parts of the tree with nails or with a hot gun.  To the triangular base you need to attach a leg.  If necessary, you can color the resulting product.  For example, give it a white or green tint.  In the center of the Christmas tree you need to pull the thread.  You can do this in even rows or create diagonals.  As pendants, you can use plastic or <span>glass balls,</span> cones, slices of oranges.  The product can be both bright and monochrome. </p><h2>  Suspension </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday pendant" class="if uuid-2431308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2431308.jpg"></div><p>  Such decor will look beautiful in a dark room.  Bright and bright Christmas balls can create a festive mood.  To make such a Christmas decor with your own hands, you will need a thick tree branch.  You can find her in the forest or in a nearby park.  It is advisable to choose a dry branch, it will be light and it can be immediately applied in the decor.  Hang the snag of your choice from the ceiling.  Now take the balls and string them on a thread.  Hang decorative elements need a wave.  But the line should be torn, not smooth.  In a chaotic manner, it is better not to hang up the toys.  This chaos will not look attractive. </p><h2>  Candles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="christmas candles" class="if uuid-2431310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2431310.jpg"></div><p>  This idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãNew Year's decor is quite simple.  To implement it, you will need: an ordinary glass jar, spruce branches, cones and salt.  Take the can and put branches on its bottom.  You do not need to break them; if they are too long, wrap them.  You can powder the bottom with artificial snow, or you can use coarse sea salt or polystyrene instead.  Put a tablet candle inside the can.  If you plan to use a home-made candlestick during all the holidays, then it makes sense to choose a larger candle.  You need to decorate the jar not only inside, but also outside.  Tie the neck with a simple thread and attach the cones.  You can gild them or paint them with white acrylic.  By the way, the jar itself can also be decorated.  For example, make something like snow with a toothbrush. </p><p>  Interesting candle holders are made from orange skins.  To make such a decor you will need an orange.  Cut the fruit in half and remove the pulp with a spoon.  To the bottom you need to attach the wick, and then pour the wax into the peel.  To enhance the aromatic effect, you can decorate an orange skin with cloves. </p><h2>  Window </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorated windows" class="if uuid-2431312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2431312.jpg"></div><p>  It is pleasant not only to yourself, but also to others to create a New Year mood.  And how can you please passers-by?  Decorate your windows.  Create Christmas paper compositions on them.  You can choose any topic.  Picture a forest with Christmas trees and bears.  Cut out the snowman and the children who sculpt it.  If you connect children to the process of making jewelry, you can recreate some fragment from a fairy tale, for example, from The Snow Queen.  To make such decor more original, it is possible to create not planar pictures, but to make volume figures.  For example, make a snowy village or create a model of an evening town.  So that the composition does not lose part of its charm in the evening, you can highlight it with a garland.  It will turn out very well to do this, if you add the lights to the composition.  For example, highlight a lantern, windows in a house, alleys in a park, etc. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt want to trouble yourself, make layouts and clippings, then you can hang a curtain of lights on the window.  She looks very attractive both outdoors and indoors.  And also you can decorate the window with interesting curly garlands.  Today you can buy lights in the store, decorated in plastic stars, snowflakes and cones. </p>
