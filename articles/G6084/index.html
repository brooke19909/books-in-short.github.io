We have to look for some kind of gadget.  Moreover, it must be cheap, the best and perfect.  Naturally, we understand that this is almost impossible.  Therefore, you have to choose according to the criteria that suit us, and also sacrifice something.  Today we will try to choose a good DAC. </p><h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  Before you deal with some models of this device, it is worth explaining what it is for those who do not know.  <span>The digital-to-analog converter is</span> designed to process a digital code into an analog signal.  So, the device can be considered a kind of "conductor" from one world - digital, in another - analog. </p>

    <p>  This device also has an ‚Äúantagonist‚Äù.  He does the same, but vice versa.  In general, the sound converter works on such a principle that in order to work it needs to receive a digital signal, which is based on pulse-code modulations.  If we have a compressed format, working with it is to use codecs. </p><h2>  Appointment </h2><p>  Naturally, to buy a good DAC, you need good reasons for this.  It is unlikely that an ordinary user will spend money on such devices.  Usually, a gadget is needed for those who want to convert signals from the digital "world" to the analog one.  As an example, it is used in a CD player. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  Depending on the purpose, it is possible to distribute the DACs into groups.  The simplest of all is considered to be pulse-width.  Most often found in devices such as Hi-Fi or where you need to control electric motors.  The principle of operation of this type is a pulse sequence that passes through a low-pass filter.  To get it, you need to wait until the converted digital code is proportional to the time for which a stable current source works. </p>

    <p>  Further we meet oversampling.  It is based on fluctuations in the value of the pulse density.  This type is designed for the correct operation of a device that has a lower capacity, with a device with a higher capacity.  It is believed that such a DAC is visualized in a single-bit model.  So, according to this technology, momentum exchange occurs with negative feedbacks. </p><p>  The weighting type assumes that the value of the current source will be proportional to the bit weight.  Nonzero bits in this case can be summed.  The staircase type received a special circuit, which consists of several resistors, has two types of inclusion. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  To choose the best DAC, you need to understand its characteristics.  So, a couple of key parameters should be highlighted.  It is important to understand the meaning of bit depth, maximum sampling rate, monotony, dynamic range, static and frequency characteristics.  So it is possible to determine the desired levels of the output signal, the frequency of stable operation, the ability of the device to increase the analog output signal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  Rating the best DACs is not so simple.  There are so many, they are all different.  Some are distinguished by external characteristics, others by technical ones.  Some have been equipped with a large number of technologies and functions, while others are aimed at specific tasks.  Therefore, making a list and sending each model to a specific place is a thankless task.  Therefore, in free order, we will consider a couple of models from the company Matrix, Meridian Audio, Esoteric, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Versatile </h2><p>  Choosing a good DAC is not a problem.  The market offers many options for converters that can suit you both in color, shape and size, as well as in technical specifications. </p><p>  Matrix Mini-I Pro was created by a Chinese company.  Many experts believe that this manufacturer unexpectedly appeared on the market and always creates a resonance that, although it does not frighten competitors, but makes them work more actively.  The company has a large selection of equipment and audio equipment.  Moreover, among the models there are both budget options for $ 200, and expensive ones for $ 1,000. </p><p>  The average gadgets include Mini-I Pro.  It is compact, and most importantly - combined.  Helps to strengthen the headphones, but it has a DAC.  For just $ 520, an audiophile will get the gadget of his dreams.  It should be understood that the dimensions of the model are really very small.  Therefore, as one of the components of a PC, the option is ideal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  On the front panel of a small device is a display.  To the left of it there is a place for connecting headphones, to the right is the volume control.  If you click on it, you can go to the options menu, where there is an output channel, digital filters, etc. There is a control panel in the kit.  The rear end is occupied by all the necessary interfaces.  There are USB, AES / EBU, XLR, etc. </p><p>  <em>Reviews</em> </p><p>  Those who chose the best DAC for headphones were incredibly happy about the appearance of this model on the market.  It is not only beautiful and compact, but also balanced and versatile.  Perhaps every user will be pleased to receive a clean, accurate and sophisticated sound.  The frequencies are heard well, both low and high sounds are noticeable. </p><p>  Buyers noted convenient control, saturation, three-dimensional bass, a pleasant shade.  Those who really understand everything in audio really appreciate this inconspicuous and functional device. </p><h2>  Upscale </h2><p>  Another representative of this manufacturer is the Matrix X-Saber.  It has standard dimensions, which in general does not prevent it from being compact, but noticeable.  Height - about 5 centimeters, width - 26 cm, and depth - 20 cm. And although at first glance we have a compact box, its weight is 4 kilograms.  For those who first encounter such a device, it‚Äôs just a ton, for connoisseurs it‚Äôs a standard weight. </p>

    <p>  The front panel is occupied by the necessary adjustment components and connectors.  Everything as a whole is clear and noticeable.  There is no optical output, although this will not be a drawback for everyone.  There is AES / EBU, which is rare. </p><p>  <em>Reviews</em> </p><p>  If you do not go into the digital component, then the real indicator of a quality DAC is sound.  In this case, users noted cleanliness, good resolution, flat and long high frequencies.  Highlighted excellent timbre with balanced tones. </p><p>  Buyers noted among the features the fast operation of the DAC, the absence of "roundness", high bass and hyperbolic coloring of the sound.  The melody has no roughness or roughness, and the frequencies are noticeable and clean. </p><h2>  Sonorous </h2><p>  Esoteric D-07X is a good DAC, which for many seems too expensive - about 6 thousand dollars.  But experts understand what such a compact equipment costs.  This option was distinguished by a good quality case, a large selection of functions and modes, and most importantly - super-high-quality sound.  In a similar model, which came out a little earlier, there was a problem with the USB receiver. </p><p>  The novelty seems to have lost this bug.  It was equipped with file translation, the ability to turn off the <span>digital filter</span> and a brand-new headphone slot.  There is an independent volume control.  Despite the large number of innovations, they practically did not affect the increase in value. </p>

    <p>  Of course, you can recommend some specific settings and adjustments to the equipment, but most likely it will be more correct for the owner to independently deal with each function in order to set the optimal modes for themselves. </p><p>  <em>Reviews</em> </p><p>  It is clear that it is impossible to find the best DACs in the world.  It all depends on the individual needs of the owner.  But this option was more successful than ever, although not very cheap.  Finding reviews about this model is not easy, since not every ordinary buyer decides to buy such a difficult to configure DAC.  Those who nevertheless left comments noted excellent sound quality, many functions, technology and work with different sources. </p><p>  If you are a novice user of such converters, you may come across new features and slots that you have not seen before.  Tuning can lead you into a dead end, which naturally leads to poor-quality sound. </p><h2>  New standards </h2><p>  Those who are familiar with expensive audio devices have at least once come across Meridian Audio products.  Some believe that it is among them that you can find the best reference DAC.  Of course, opinion is subjective, but not unfounded. </p><p>  More recently, users met with Meridian Ultra Digital to Analogue Converter.  This model has become the main "brainchild" of the company.  At the presentation, a loud statement was made that this option is the culmination of all the work that has been carried out over 20 years.  The novelty has wide connectivity, many user functions, support for a variety of formats.  Equipped Ultra DAC with a number of new technologies that increase sound quality, use a number of filters, and increase frequencies. </p>

    <p>  In fact, this model is really a great option, because it can connect via USB, AES3, TosLink, S / PDIF.  There is an excellent music platform that has managed to receive many awards.  In addition to these interfaces, balanced and unbalanced analog outputs can be used. </p><p>  <em>Reviews</em> </p><p>  Both the manufacturer and the users of these models considered these to be the best DAC amplifiers.  Meridian Audio once again managed to prove its superiority in the market and that it can create a high-end product. </p><p>  Customers responded positively to features, including PC setup, LipSync, and RS232.  Thanks to them, it became possible to integrate the device with systems of other manufacturers.  We noted the presence of three oversampling filters, which are often used at 44kHz and 48kHz. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  A good external DAC is not easy to choose.  You have to put up with this.  If you need it at work, then most likely you are already familiar with certain models and manufacturers, and it is easier for you to make a choice.  If, on the contrary, for the first time you decide to make a purchase of a DAC, you will have to understand for what purposes you choose equipment, what you expect from it.  Of course, it is necessary to study the reviews, since the characteristics do not always correspond to reality, or in reality turn out to be true.  Well, you can not "rush" to a beautiful model.  If you have a nice design, this does not mean that the sound will completely satisfy you. </p>
