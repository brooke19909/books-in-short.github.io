It was a <span>bourgeois-democratic revolution,</span> which began with mass anti-government protests of the workers, which were supported by the soldiers of the Petrograd garrison.  All this led to the actual overthrow of the absolute monarchy in the country and the creation of the Provisional Government, which concentrated the executive and legislative powers in their hands.  The revolution itself began in late February and continued until early March. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reasons for the February Revolution" class="if uuid-2475025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475025.jpg"></div><p>  Assessing the consequences of the February revolution, we must first understand its causes.  Most modern historians come to the unequivocal conclusion that it was inevitable, since a large number of factors caused dissatisfaction with the government and the king. </p><p>  Among them, defeats on the fronts of the First World War, the difficult situation in which the peasants and workers found themselves, the devastation and famine in the country, political disempowerment, the authority of the autocratic power had greatly decreased by that time, society had long demanded cardinal reforms that the authorities did not want to carry out. </p><p>  It turned out that almost all the problems that Russia faced during the 1905 revolution remained unresolved.  <span>The manifesto of October 17, 1905</span> was supposed to radically change the life of the people, but this did not happen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rasputin's position at court </h2><p>  By examining the causes, course, consequences of the February Revolution, we can fully appreciate the social upheavals that occurred at that time.  Great discontent was caused by the situation, which by that time Grigory Rasputin had occupied the court.  The supreme power was actually discredited by scandals around the figure of this old man. </p><p>  In the capital, rumors circulated about treason in the circles of the emperor.  Public opinion was considered a traitor to the wife of the head of state, Alexander Fedorovna, there was even talk of an intimate relationship between the empress and Rasputin.  Most of them were fantastic and never received confirmation, but had a strong influence on public opinion. </p><h2>  Bread riots </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.jacobinmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mass strikes" class="if uuid-2475024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475024.jpg"></div><p>  From this article you can learn in detail about the February Revolution, its premises, results and consequences.  The actual start of the unrest, which culminated in overt anti-government protests, is commonly considered the so-called bread riots. </p><p>  They began in Petrograd, becoming the logical conclusion to the <span>crisis situation</span> with transport and the supply of bread. </p><p>  At the end of 1916, an additional appraisal was introduced, which was aimed at fulfilling food procurement during the economic and military crises.  First of all, it was about grain harvesting.  The principle of food unfolding consisted in the forced delivery of grain products by producers at prices established by the state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But even despite such coercive measures, instead of the 772 million pounds of bread that was planned to be obtained, only 170 million pounds were managed to be obtained.  Because of this, soldiers rations were reduced in the army from 3 to 2 pounds per day for those who fought at the front, those who remained in the front-line zone received 1.5 pounds each. </p><p>  <span>Food cards</span> were introduced in almost all major cities.  At the same time, huge lines lined up for bread, but not all received it.  In Vitebsk, Kostroma, Polotsk, famine began. </p><p>  There were no cards in Petrograd, but rumors that they were about to appear were actively circulating.  Outraged people started active actions on February 21, when pogroms in dairy shops and bakeries began in Petrograd.  The crowd demanded bread. </p><h2>  Start </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Consequences of the February Revolution" class="if uuid-2475017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475017.jpg"></div><p>  The causes and consequences of the February Revolution have been trying to assess historians for over a century.  Many believe that one of the factors that led to the uprising was the departure of the king from the capital.  February 22, Nicholas II leaves for Mogilev, where the headquarters of the Supreme Commander was located. </p><p>  The Minister of Internal Affairs Protopopov, seeing him off, assures that the situation is under his full control.  And Protopopov was really sure of this, because at the end of January he managed to arrest workers who were preparing a mass demonstration on the day of the opening of a new session of the State Duma. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The actual beginning of the revolution is February 23.  Anti-war rallies in the capital are growing into demonstrations and mass strikes.  The work of several large industrial enterprises was stopped.  In the center of Petrograd, demonstrators come into direct conflict with the police and Cossacks. </p><p>  On February 24, more than 200 thousand people are participating in a general strike.  February 26 demonstration begins on Nevsky Prospekt.  On Znamenskaya Square, police open fire on demonstrators, about 40 people were killed.  They shoot in other parts of the city.  The number of participants in the strike exceeds 300 thousand people. </p><h2>  Armed rebellion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="moldova-suverana.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="February Revolution" class="if uuid-2475020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475020.jpg"></div><p>  The turning point occurred on February 27, when the soldiers began to massively switch to the side of the rebels.  The first in the riot began to participate the team of the reserve battalion of the Volyn regiment.  The soldiers killed the commanders, released all those who were on the guardhouse, began to call the neighboring units to join the uprising.  Officers were either killed or scattered. </p><p>  On the same day, soldiers fully armed went to Liteiny Prospekt, where they teamed up with the striking workers of the Petrograd factories. </p><p>  And on the same day, members of the government gather for an emergency meeting at the Mariinsky Palace.  It was decided to send a telegram to the emperor in Mogilev, which indicates that the Council of Ministers is not able to cope with the situation in the country.  At the same time, the government dismissed Protopopov, who caused particular irritation among the opposition.  In the meantime, the uprising spread beyond Petrograd. </p><p>  On February 28, the Interim Committee, organized by the State Duma, officially announced that it was taking power into its own hands.  It was recognized by foreign governments, in particular, France and the United Kingdom. </p><h2>  Emperor's abdication </h2><p>  Further, the chronology of events developed as follows.  On March 2, the representative of the Provisional Committee, Guchkov and Shulgin, came to Nicholas II, telling him that they saw the only way out of this situation in his abdication in favor of a minor heir.  Otherwise, riots could begin in the troops that were at the front. </p><p>  In this case, it was planned to appoint Grand Duke Mikhail as regent.  The emperor said that he had made such a decision in the afternoon, and now he was ready to renounce both himself and his son. </p><p>  At 23.40, Nicholas II passes the official act of abdication in favor of his brother Mikhail Alexandrovich.  The latter fact provoked the indignation of the leaders of the revolution.  His supporters did not advise him to take power, as a result, he did so by refusing to accept the supreme power. </p><p>  The executive committee of the Petrosoviet decided to arrest the entire royal family, deprive them of civil rights and confiscate property.  On March 9, the emperor arrived in Tsarskoye Selo as Colonel Romanov. </p><h2>  Revolution takes over the whole country </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sites.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir Lenin" class="if uuid-2475018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475018.jpg"></div><p>  From the capital, the revolution spreads throughout the country.  February 28 begins a strike at Moscow factories.  The crowd reaches the Butyrka prison, from which 350 political prisoners are being released.  The revolutionaries take control of the telegraph, mail and telephone, train stations, weapons arsenal and the Kremlin.  Gendarmes and city arrests, begin to form police units. </p><p>  After Moscow, the revolution spreads throughout Russia.  By March 3, revolutionary authorities are being formed in Nizhny Novgorod, Vologda, and Saratov.  In Samara, a crowd storms a governor's prison.  When the news of the emperor‚Äôs abdication of the throne reaches Kiev, the formation of new authorities immediately begins.  But if dual power arises in most cities - the radical Soviets and the liberal Executive Committee are fighting, then the nationalist Central Council also appears in Kiev. </p><p>  In Minsk, revolutionary bodies are formed on March 2. </p><h2>  Formation of the Provisional Government </h2><p>  The main consequence of the February revolution was the formation of the Provisional Government.  He is headed by Prince Lvov, who remains in this post until July 1917, when he will be replaced by Kerensky. </p><p>  The interim government immediately stated that its main goal would be to transfer power to the Constituent Assembly, the elections for which are scheduled for September 17, but will be postponed to November. </p><p>  At the same time, the Petrograd Soviet of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies enjoys serious influence.  As a result, the <span>Provisional Government is</span> trying to follow the path of parliamentarism, seeking to make Russia a modern liberal and capitalist power on the Western model.  The Petrograd Soviet stands for the revolutionary power of the working masses. </p><h2>  Consequences of the February Revolution </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kgou.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="February Revolution Events" class="if uuid-2475019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475019.jpg"></div><p>  The main symbols of this revolution are red banners and bows.  The fourth convocation of the State Duma plays a huge role in it, but then it quickly loses influence. </p><p>  During the revolutionary events themselves, the role of deputy Kerensky, who is also part of the Provisional Government, is growing significantly.  The results and consequences of the February Revolution are still being evaluated and discussed by many.  One of the main decisions in the early days is the requirement to abolish the death penalty, to provide equal rights to all citizens, regardless of their gender, nationality or religion.  Discriminatory restrictions are being lifted, in particular, with respect to Jews, before that they were constrained by the so-called Pale of Settlement, Jews could not live in the capitals and large cities of the empire. </p><p>  All citizens, without exception, received the right to assemble freely, to join any unions and associations, and trade unions really began to work in the country. </p><p>  Another important consequence of the February Revolution was that the tsarist police, as well as the gendarmerie, were disbanded, their functions passed to the people's militia, which they began to call the police.  An Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry was also formed by the Provisional Government, which was engaged in the investigation of crimes committed by senior officials and tsarist ministers. </p><p>  The Provisional Government began to actually consider itself a full successor to the monarchical state, seeking to preserve the previously existing state apparatus. </p><h2>  Government crises </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.awesomestories.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Background of the February Revolution" class="if uuid-2475023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475023.jpg"></div><p>  Moreover, the fact that the Provisional Government could not cope with the situation in the country can be attributed to the results and consequences of the February Revolution.  The consequence of this were government crises that began on May 3. </p><p>  As a result, the government became coalition. </p><p>  At the same time, a serious blow was inflicted on the army, this was another consequence of the February revolution in Russia.  During the mass purge of the command staff, officers who were close to the Duma opposition were appointed to key posts.  The most striking figures were Kolchak, Kornilov, Denikin. </p><h2>  Fear of dictatorship </h2><p>  Speaking briefly about the consequences of the February Revolution, it should be noted that the fear of a military dictatorship has become comprehensive.  That is why Kerensky was in a hurry to consolidate the successes that had been achieved without waiting for the decisions of the Constituent Assembly. </p><p>  On September 1, the Provisional Government announced the creation of the Russian Republic. </p><p>  The consequences of the February and October revolution in Russia were decisive for the fate of the whole country in the XX century.  She said goodbye to the monarchy and took a fundamentally different path. </p>
