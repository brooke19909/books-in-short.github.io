Until its validity has expired, the owner bank may repledge or sell the mortgage to other financial and credit organizations.  Of course, only with the personal consent of the borrower.  However, this does not have any significant effect on the security itself: the terms of the mortgage agreement, as well as the conditions of the mortgage, are unchanged. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Large banks, for example, do not consider it necessary to oblige the borrower to sign a mortgage, because there are impressive financial assets in their reserves, that is, they do not risk losing any significant amount for themselves.  But not so large participants in the credit and financial market insist on issuing a mortgage in order to protect themselves.

The essence of mortgages is refinancing, that is, mortgage debt can be sold or mortgaged.  The Mortgage Institute was introduced recently, which undoubtedly means progress in the development of the debt securities market.  Thus, banks will be able to sell debt in the secondary market, thereby providing themselves with an extensive base of cash resources for long-term lending. </p><p>  In the mortgage, the most important thing is the massive lending by banks of buildings under construction and finished.  Long-term housing loans cannot be based solely on deposits and other accounts of depositors.  Massive and <span>long-term lending to</span> construction and the purchase of private real estate require refinancing opportunities, including in the stock market.  World financial history has proved the impossibility of a normal development of the housing loan market without mortgages. </p><h2>  Conditions for issuing a mortgage </h2><p>  This security may be issued subject to three conditions: </p><ul><li>  the main liability is monetary; </li><li>  when concluding a mortgage agreement, the amount of debt is indicated according to it or the criteria by which it can be determined; </li><li>  the mortgage agreement must contain a clause on the issue of the mortgage. </li></ul>

But it must be remembered that a mortgage is a security, the obligations of which are secured by a pledge.  The holder may collect the subject of the mortgage loan or obtain performance under the main contract precisely under the mortgage, and not on the basis of the mortgage or main contract.  In addition, one of the features of a mortgage is the obligatory state registration of this security. </p><p>  The mortgagor issues the document.  A mortgage is a pledge agreement, which is issued in a single copy, in writing, on a special standard form.  State registration of a mortgage assumes the existence of an individual registration number and seal, without which this security is considered invalid. </p>

    <p>  A mortgage in the securities market is a document that meets a number of requirements.  In particular, it must be literal, that is, certain details must be present on paper.  The presence of not all of them automatically nullifies its value. </p><p>  In addition to the points and data established by law, the mortgage may contain information indicated by the mortgagee and the mortgagor.  For example, it may be certain sanctions applicable to the borrower in case of late payment of the next payment, or some additional features involving the preservation of the mortgaged property.  The Bank has the right to independently set forth these additional conditions without the participation of the debtor. </p><h2>  Mortgage transfer and its legal consequences </h2><p>  The transfer of a mortgage in the legal sense is divided into two stages: </p><ul><li>  execution of <span>endorsement</span> in favor of an endorser (any third party); </li><li>  actual transfer of the original. </li></ul>

Having received the document, the endorser becomes the owner of all the rights of the mortgagee under the mortgage and main agreements.  The endorser is responsible to him for the degree of reliability of the information contained in the transferred security.  In addition, the transfer of a mortgage means confirmation by an endorser of the conscientious fulfillment of all obligations of the debtor under the contract.  After the transfer of the paper, the mortgagor declines all responsibility to the endorser for the non-fulfillment of any obligations by the debtor.

    <p>  However, there is a reservation in the Law "On Mortgage", providing for the designation of conditions for liability.  Thus, the mortgage buyer increases their own comfort and security of their investments. </p><h2>  Mortgage Refinancing </h2><p>  The Law "On Mortgage" provides several ways to allow refinancing using mortgages: </p><ul><li>  mortgage sale; </li><li>  her pledge; </li><li>  sale of this document with a prerequisite for its repurchase; </li><li>  issue of mortgage securities. </li></ul><p>  A very important nuance in this matter is that a mortgage can be refinanced only before the debtor fulfills all loan obligations. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of mortgage securities </h2><p>  The benefits of issuing mortgage bonds and certificates are: </p><ul><li>  obtaining by the mortgage <span>market financial</span> resources, allowing to expand the scope of mortgage lending; </li><li>  investors receive securities with high returns and guarantees. </li></ul><p>  The disadvantage of mortgage bonds and certificates for the owner is the ability to repay the loan by the debtor ahead of time.  The risk of returning the <span>face value of the</span> certificate is high, as a result of which the owner of the mortgage security will be deprived of long-term profit in the form of interest. </p>
