First, they prepare elastic bands for the body of an owl, weave it according to the scheme, and then move on to the head. </p><h2>  Weave the body </h2><p>  The first red gum should be thrown in three turns on the right column.  Then put the two red on two pins.  After that, the initial gum of three turns is thrown off to the center.  Release the right column - transfer the gum to the left side). </p><h2>  Weave a foot </h2><p>  One orange gum wraps 4 times on the right side of the slingshot.  2 redheads put on as usual.  The orange of 4 turns should be lowered to the rubber bands.  From the left column, the lower 2 pairs should also be sent to the center so that the orange is on their right.  After that, 2 redheads are again thrown, and the lower ones are sent to the middle.  The second pair of red ones is put on 2 columns, the lower ones are sent to them.  The third pair is thrown on both sides of the slingshot, the lower ones are dumped into the center.  Then the gum should be transferred from the left side of the slingshot to the right.  Next, the hook is inserted into the initial gum of 3 turns, after which it is thrown on the left column. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave an owl on a slingshot from elastic bands" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/1920440.jpg" width="394"></div></h2><h2>  Weave abdomen </h2><p>  Having thrown 2 white elastic bands, we send a triple elastic band in the middle.  The second white pair is worn similarly, the lower whites descend from the columns.  The third and fourth pair are also weaved.  White gum is transferred from the left to the right.  The hook is once again inserted inside the initial triple gum, which is worn on the left pin. </p><p>  Next, 2 red gum put on both columns, 3 turns to the left are sent to the center.  The left gum is transferred to the right, four turns of orange gum are wound onto the left pin.  They throw a couple more red ones, after which the orange is lowered from the pin. </p><p>  From the right column, you should discard the 2 upper pairs of red ones so that the orange is left.  Then they put on 2 redheads, and the previous ones are sent to the center.  They put on a couple of redheads again and lower the previous ones from both columns.  The next pair is also worn, with the previous ones being discarded from the columns. </p><p>  Using the following pair of red gums, they connect everything together, i.e.  the pair is worn on both sides of the slingshot.  The lower gum is sent from the slingshot to the middle of the weave. </p><h2>  Weave our head </h2><p>  Gum should be laid out in the form of a diagram.  A pair of redheads from the right row are put on in the usual way, the lower ones are thrown off in the middle.  Then another pair is put on, and the lower ones again go to the center.  Left gum should be moved to the right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Weave the eye </h2><p>  The black elastic band is thrown in 4 turns on the left pin.  Again, a red pair is thrown and black elastic bands are removed on it in 4 turns.  Both lower pairs to the right are also sent, but so that the black is left on the left.  Then they throw another 2 red gum, the lower ones are sent to the middle. </p><p>  After that, you should free the left column by moving the gum from it to the right.  The hook is inserted into the loop with which weaving of the head began.  2 orange loops are thrown on the hook.  The second part is drawn through the loop and also throws onto the hook, from which orange loops descend to the left pin. </p><p>  Next, a pair of red rubber bands is put on both columns, orange ones are removed on them.  Erasers are carried from left to right.  The hook should again be introduced into the initial loop, a pair of red loops should be thrown onto the hook, extending one side and putting the other on the hook.  The gum should be lowered from the hook to the left column.  Wear 2 red loops on both posts.  2 pairs of redheads on the left to lower to the center of work. </p><p>  On the right column, you should pick up the 2 upper elastic bands and transfer them to the left.  Throw the black 11 gum in 4 turns on the right side of the slingshot.  Next, a pair of red gum is put on both columns and black turns go down.  On the left side of the slingshot, all the elastic bands are thrown so that the black is on their right.  Having put on a couple of redheads, the previous ones should be sent to the middle. </p><p>  Next, all the elastic bands on the slingshot should be connected, put one red on two columns, send all the elastic bands from the slingshot to the center.  Next, one of the gum is transferred to the adjacent column.  Lower goes down to the center.  The loop should be tightened properly. </p><h2>  Weaving brushes </h2><p>  The hook is inserted into the upper left loop of the head and one red gum is stretched through it, a loop is made.  The same thing is repeated on the left side.  Next, each prepared rubber should be pulled off and about half cut with scissors. </p><h2>  How to weave an owl from gum on the machine? </h2><p>  This way of the craftswoman is considered perhaps the simplest of all known.  But not everyone knows how to weave an owl out of gum using a machine.  To do this, first choose gum of a suitable color for making an owl, and then proceed according to the scheme: consistently throw gum on the appropriate posts of the machine. </p>

    <p>  Then the gum from the column are thrown off and intertwined.  The process of weaving an owl on the machine consists in folding and throwing gum.  As a result of the steps, a wicker toy is obtained: after removal from the machine, the gum is pulled together.  The owl is ready! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave an owl action figure out of rubber bands" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/1920442.jpg" width="458"></div></h2><h2>  3D Rubber Owl </h2><p>  Many are interested in <span>how to weave a 3D owl</span> out of elastic bands.  To do this, use the technique of weaving lumigurumi.  This is a very popular technique for weaving various figures and bracelets from gum, based on amigurumi. </p><p>  The difference between these Japanese types of needlework is that amigurumi is knitting toys in a circle using a hook and thread, while lumigurumi uses a hook and elastic bands.  How to weave an owl from gum on a hook using the lumigurumi method? </p><h2>  Progress: weave the main part </h2><p>  In the process of weaving, you will have to use: </p><ul><li>  elastic bands of different colors; </li><li>  crochet; </li><li>  filler for toys. </li></ul><p>  According to the reviews of experienced craftswomen, such a toy is woven easily enough, it will not take much time to make it.  An essential advantage of this method is that one whole piece is woven, consisting of a body, a head and ears.  The exceptions are the wings, eyes and beak of an owl.  Work begins from the bottom, for this, with the help of green rubber bands, a special ring of six loops is formed. </p>

    <p>  In the second row, weaving should be slightly increased, so twelve elastic bands are woven there, two through each loop.  Then again you need to add, but after only one loop.  Green rubber bands need to weave one row with an increase.  The result should be 24 loops.  A row weaves with the addition of every third loop. </p><p>  The next row is braided without adding, just weave 24 gum in all rows.  Since the owl should be striped, the gum should be changed every two rows.  In total, sixteen rows should be woven. </p><h2>  How to weave eyes? </h2><p>  To do this, you need rubber bands in white and black.  First you need to make a ring of six black loops.  Next, one row weaves two white in each loop. </p><h2>  How to make a beak? </h2><p>  Throw the orange gum over the hook three times, and then place it on two of the same gum.  One end should be left hanging down freely.  Then a couple more elastic bands are threaded, the hanging elastic bands are returned to the hook.  Another pair is thrown onto the hook, which is pulled through the first two loops.  Erasers are going to one. </p><p>  Eyes are sewn with a regular seam, while using elastic bands of any of the available colors. </p><p>  To attach the beak, first pull one end of the gum inward, and then stretch the second end, backing off the loop, and fix it inside with an orange gum. </p><h2>  Wings </h2><p>  To weave the wings of an owl, you need to form a ring of six green rubber bands.  Next, we need to weave two rows of twelve elastic bands, making an increase in each loop, while the color must be changed every two elastic bands.  The wings are attached at the end. </p><h2>  Final actions </h2><p>  At the last stage, the owl is filled with a synthetic winterizer and the head is sewn together.  The ears will form themselves.  In the corners, stretch three orange gum, making nodules out of them.  Erasers are cut, resulting in brushes. </p>
