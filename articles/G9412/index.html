  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Maltaoption.net: reviews and review</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Maltaoption is a brokerage company that offers its own bonus program.  She offers to get a starting no deposit bonus of $ 100 for the registration procedure.  However, it is quite difficult for users to return the invested funds. </p><h2>  Trading conditions </h2><p>  The broker offers a simple procedure for registering on the site, since users just need to fill out a short form with contact and personal data.  The system transfers the user to the <span>trading platform</span> immediately after he agrees to the current conditions.  Moreover, the platform does not require additional confirmation.  The site https: \\ maltaoption.net reviews are mostly negative, because users talk about its limited number of functions.  MaltaOption offers market participants the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  minimum rate of 25 dollars; </li><li>  minimum deposit is $ 200; </li><li>  access to quotes: 24 currency pairs, 26 investment assets, precious metals; </li><li>  market participants have access to short options; </li><li>  total return on open positions does not exceed 85%; </li><li>  lack of a demo account. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="binaryoptionexpert.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Participation in binary options" class="if uuid-2450237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2450237.jpg"></div><p>  Broker's dishonest activity becomes apparent after a quick look at the site.  The statement that the broker has been operating in the market for 3 years is knowingly false.  Simple manipulations let you see that MaltaOption has been on the market since April 2017.  Therefore, reviews about maltaoption.net say that this is a fraudulent service that was created under the guise of a serious broker. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Company reviews </h2><p>  Negative reviews about maltaoption.net suggest that the broker does not differ in responsibility and reliability.  This is due to the fact that a reliable broker will not rebrand on a regular basis.  As a rule, such organizations work for a reputation, therefore they try to keep the brand at a high level.  Reviews of maltaoption.net suggest that this is an ordinary divorce, since this system involves the earnings of a broker, not market participants.  Before you begin cooperation with any broker, you should familiarize yourself with his license to carry out this type of activity.  An unofficial license is posted on maltaoption.net, which is edited in the Photoshop program.  Based on the fact that the company carries out falsification of documents and assigns a license without any reason, we can conclude that this broker is a fraudster. </p><div class="photo" data-original="upgradedpoints.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Options Fraud" class="if uuid-2450248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2450248.jpg"></div><p>  This organization is deceiving its own customers even in such an elementary matter.  The activity of this broker has nothing to do with real trading.  Market participants cannot withdraw funds from a deposit due to an inactive account.  To do this, the site administration requires you to deposit money in the account.  In other words, for a trader to earn $ 300, he will need to invest $ 300.  This is the essence of the scam from this broker.  Therefore, there are many negative reviews about this company, because after entering real money they cannot be returned back.  Also, the broker is on the black list, so market participants cannot withdraw funds from the account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Trading platform </h2><p>  Many professional market participants are concerned about the fact that the platform works only with short-term options.  The platform itself is a classic development of a spot option, which is presented in a very truncated form.  Traders can trade within 30 seconds or 1-2 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vortexzsignals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Profitable Binary Option" class="if uuid-2450241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2450241.jpg"></div><p>  Many market participants attribute this to a major drawback, since short-term options are the most risky category.  The platform does not provide opportunities for traders to trade even for 5 minutes.  Therefore, the strategies and tactics that are used on binary options are practically not applicable.  There are also positive reviews about maltaoption.net regarding the operation of the platform, since it has a large selection of underlying assets. </p><h2>  Bonuses </h2><p>  The management declares that traders can receive a bonus of $ 100 for simple registration on the platform.  To do this, just go to your personal account and find a letter with a code.  However, withdrawing this bonus from the account is unrealistic.  Also, the broker is given a mythical opportunity to accrue certain bonuses on a deposit, the amount of which can reach 100%. </p><h2>  Account Types </h2><p>  The site presents several types of accounts that can be found.  Most traders use a Silver account.  It includes deposits ranging in size from $ 200 to $ 499.  Many traders open their first deposit on this trading account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vortexzsignals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of Binary Options" class="if uuid-2450267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2450267.jpg"></div><p>  However, the platform does not provide market participants with access to training materials, a manager account, and free webinars.  Withdrawal payments are subject to a commission of 3%.  Therefore, this platform does not have advantages, and attractive conditions are only falsification. </p><h2>  The opinion of traders </h2><p>  <span>Reviews about the platform in the best way can tell you what the company really is.</span>  <span>Many market participants say that this organization conducts fraudulent activities.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> of maltaoption.net <span>suggest that incoming signals do not reflect current information, since they close at a loss.</span>  <span>Many say that the platform slows down when doing work.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kexworks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Binary Options Reviews" class="if uuid-2450244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2450244.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews of maltaoption.net <span>suggest that it is impossible to withdraw funds and even a bonus, since it was received voluntarily.</span>  <span>Therefore, until it is worked out, the system will not provide a withdrawal option.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> of maltaoption.net <span>suggest that traders do not have the opportunity to contact the support service and site administration.</span>  <span>The main drawback is the mismatch of the market charts of the information presented on the site.</span>  <span>The broker sets his own quotes, which are impossible to work with.</span> </p><h2>  Brief conclusions </h2><p>  The analysis allows us to conclude that the Malta Option is a fraud of potential investors.  It is simply impossible to withdraw real money from this resource.  Therefore, cooperation with this company can lead to the loss of invested money.  Positive feedback about maltaoption.net is left directly by the site administration in order to attract the attention of potential investors. </p>
