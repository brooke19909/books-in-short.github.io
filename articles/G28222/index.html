  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Anapa city: beaches and attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the Russian south there are a large number of resort cities.  Among them, the city of Anapa (Krasnodar Territory), located on the border of the Taman Peninsula and the mountain system between the Black and Caspian Seas.  It covers an area of ​​5840 square meters.  km  Anapa is home to over 75,400 indigenous people. </p><p>  In the article we will talk about the main attractions of this resort, beaches and hotels, which are designed for those wishing to relax on the Black Sea. </p><h2>  History of Anapa </h2><p>  According to archaeological excavations, the area of ​​modern Anapa was inhabited by Sinds (tribes of the Northern Black Sea region).  After some time, the Greeks settled on this territory.  They founded the city of Sindik. </p><p>  In the IX century BC  e.  the city became part of the Bosporus kingdom and became known as Gorgipp.  Subsequently, it was ravaged and destroyed in 240 by the Iranian-speaking tribe of the Alans. </p><p>  In the X century, the territory was inhabited by the ancestors of the Circassians (a group of peoples speaking Adyghe languages), thanks to which the city received the name "Anapa".  Translated, it is "a flat ledge of the sea shore." </p><p>  After 300 years, a fortress was built by merchants from Genoa, which was captured and destroyed by the Ottoman Turks.  And in its place they built one of the main defensive strongholds of the Ottoman Empire - Anape fortress.  After six attempts, Russian troops captured this fortified Ottoman fort.  And, according to the Adrianople Treaty, since 1828 Anapa became part of the Russian state. </p><p>  Since 1900, the city began to develop as a Russian Black Sea resort, thanks to the Kuban doctor Vladimir Budzinsky.  Now Anapa is a modern developed resort.  On its territory, in addition to sanatoriums, rest houses and numerous beaches and all the conditions for outdoor activities, there are historical cultural monuments that attract the attention of guests and tourists from many European countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian gate in Anapa" class="if uuid-2308956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2308956.jpg"></div><h2>  Russian gate </h2><p>  At the intersection of Pushkin and Fortress streets is a monument of architecture - "Russian Gate".  It is the only part of the Ottoman fortress. </p><p>  In 1783, a citadel was erected by the Turks in this urban area, which served as the defense of the Caucasus coast.  Initially, it consisted of a territory surrounded by a fortified wall, in the corners of which were located seven bastions and three buildings in the form of an entrance gate.  The construction itself has not survived to our time.  Tourists can only visit the east gate.  They were named "Russians" in 1853, in honor of the 25th anniversary of the liberation of Anapa in 1828 by Russian troops from the dominion of the Ottoman Empire. </p><p>  In 1996, a stele was erected.  A plate is installed there, on which it is written that the remains of the soldiers of the Russian Empire, who died for the liberation of the city from the Turkish invaders, rest here. </p><h2>  Temple of Onufry the Great </h2><p>  What attracts tourists besides beaches?  <span>Attractions Anapa.</span>  There are a lot of them in the city.
