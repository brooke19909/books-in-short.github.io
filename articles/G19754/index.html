Maybe it's the phone.  Therefore, it is recommended to check the volume first.  If everything is okay with her, but the sound is still quiet, then try playing the audio file through another application.  If the volume is still low, then the matter is trash.  The only option is to take apart EarPods to clean them. </p><h2>  Why are headphones clogged up with garbage? </h2><p>  No matter how you protect them from pollution, one day anyway the moment will come when they become clogged.  This is due to the design, and perhaps Apple‚Äôs desire to earn a little more on accessories.  EarPods are great for anyone due to their shape, but it also kills them.  We will figure out how to properly disassemble EarPods and remove garbage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.t3.com" data-author=": t3, " data-source="https://www.t3.com/reviews/apple-earpods-review"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disassemble earpods for cleaning" class="if uuid-2996413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113975/2996413.jpg"></div><h2>  Surface cleaning </h2><p>  In this case, you don‚Äôt need to think about how to disassemble Apple EarPods.  Everything is very simple here.  All you need is a toothpick or needle and wet cotton. </p><ol><li>  We take EarPods and, slightly pressing, we clear large garbage from an external part of an earphone. </li><li>  Wipe the net with a small piece of wet cotton. </li></ol><p>  We connect EarPods to the phone and check.  If the volume remains at the same low level, it means that the dirt got through the mesh to the inner membrane.  Therefore, we need a more difficult option.  However, here you do not need to think how to parse EarPods: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Take a toothbrush. </li><li>  Carefully remove the mesh. </li><li>  We clear the earphone of dirt and put it in its place. </li></ol><h2>  Peroxide magic </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="EarPods Shoe" class="if uuid-2997037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113975/2997037.jpg"></div><p>  How to disassemble EarPods for cleaning if the mesh is not removed?  It is advisable not to do this, since you are unlikely to be able to put it back.  But this does not mean that the headphones can no longer be cleaned.  For this method you will need a cotton swab and hydrogen peroxide.  Detailed instructions: </p><ol><li>  We abundantly wet one end of a cotton swab with hydrogen peroxide. </li><li>  Gently drop it into the earpiece. </li><li>  A small drop will appear.  Make sure that it is not too large, otherwise the liquid will get inside and the earphone will deteriorate. </li><li>  If the droplet holds and does not decrease, then you did everything right.  After a few seconds, the liquid will begin to foam.  This is a reaction of peroxide to sulfur. </li><li>  When the drop is completely covered with foam, remove it with the dry part of a cotton swab.  Then you should wipe the mesh dry. </li></ol><p>  After that, you can already use the headphones.  But it is advisable to turn them with a net down and allow to dry.  This method may be unsafe if you do it carelessly.  Therefore, there is another option, but more complex. </p><h2>  Effective method </h2><p>  If you are afraid to drip peroxide into the earphone, you can try this option.  You will need: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  empty packaging for tablets (such that EarPods fits completely into it and lies flat); </li><li>  hydrogen peroxide. </li></ul><p>  This method is more secure.  But it will be difficult to find a package of tablets ideal for the size of the earphone.  If you find, you can proceed: </p><ol><li>  We put the package so that it lies flat and does not bend anywhere. </li><li>  We drop 2-3 drops of hydrogen peroxide into the well from the tablets. </li><li>  Gently place EarPods with the speaker down.  Through the transparent side we can see the level of peroxide.  It is desirable that it does not rise above 5 mm. </li><li>  We fix the earphone and leave it for 15-30 minutes. </li></ol><p>  If everything is OK with the device and headphones, these methods should help you. </p><h2>  What if all methods are ineffective? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphonelife.com" data-author=": Sarah Kingsbury, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple EarPods" class="if uuid-2997050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113975/2997050.jpg"></div><p>  Check the sequence of actions.  Try again.  If again there is no positive result, try connecting other headphones to the device.  If everything is all right with them, then it‚Äôs yours.  If they also make a quiet sound, the problem is in the smartphone. </p><p>  Since all Apple devices are warranted, you can take EarPods to a certified service center or buy new ones.  If the matter is in the device, do not try to repair it yourself.  The problem may be deeper than you think.  It is better to take the device to a service center, wait for the results of the diagnosis, and after that make a decision. </p>
