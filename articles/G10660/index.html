    <h2>  Old Nessebar (Bulgaria) </h2><p>  The ancient part of the city is located on a small peninsula, which is connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus.  Arriving here, you can immerse yourself in a unique atmosphere, inspect the remains of the churches, the ancient port and the walls that were destroyed by time.  Walking along the cobbled streets, you can admire the buildings of the 19th century and ancient buildings with wooden bay windows.  Here you will find the Archaeological and Ethnographic museums, in which everyone has the opportunity to get acquainted with the amazing history of this part of the country.  You will not be indifferent when you see in the first museum an impressive collection of icons, figured ceramics of the Middle Ages and Antiquity, as well as Thracian stone anchors.  And in the second you can get acquainted with the costumes of the Bulgarians and their traditional jewelry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Nessebar.

The main part of the buildings is perfectly preserved, and the other is represented in the form of ruins, which are still admired by the guests of this wonderful country. </p><p>  The Church of Christ Pantocrator (Almighty) is considered one of the most beautiful in all of Bulgaria.  It was built in the 12th century, but even today it is able to impress tourists with the richness of decoration and the bizarre form.  The fifth-century Metropolitan Church is the oldest building in the city.  Legend has it that the builders erected it on the ruins of an ancient temple dedicated to Apollo.  In the Church of St. Stephen, which was built by Christians in the ninth century, you can see the well-preserved murals of the 16th century, the iconostasis, the pulpit and the throne of the bishop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Nessebar.

Resort Nessebar </h2><p>  Many vacationers consider the beaches of the city and its environs the most beautiful in the country.  Environmentalists also agree with this opinion, having awarded the Blue Flag international award to a wide strip of golden sand.  Locals and tourists come here, tired of visiting many attractions.  Nessebar (Bulgaria) does everything so that its guests are not bored.  On the beach of the resort town, you can rent a yacht, go windsurfing and diving under the guidance of an instructor, play volleyball and hide from the sun in the nearest cafe or restaurant.  From here you can go on an excursion or get to Sunny Beach, Burgas and St. Vlas. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  Aqua Paradise is located just four kilometers from the city center.  It can be easily reached by a free bus from Sveti Vlas, Sunny Beach and Ravda.  At the height of the holiday season, the water park operates seven days a week and receives visitors from morning to evening.  However, most of the slides, attractions and pools are in the open.  Therefore, in case of bad weather, it is closed completely or partially. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria.
