Thanks to this, not only beautiful, but also practical things are created.  Cross-stitch letter patterns are used in both decorative and applied embroidery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="backstitch embroidery" class="if uuid-3134767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3134767.jpg"></div><h2>  Application options </h2><p>  On the canvas, you can embroider not only a picture, but also an original motif that will correspond to a specific person.  Wedding and children's metrics are considered a popular gift, because embroidered names and dates will remind you of an important event. </p><p>  Also, needlewoman cross-stitch patterns are used to create samplers or thematic embroidery.  Small fonts are used here, but large schemes can also be used for capital letters.  An alternative to the technique is the smooth surface, thanks to its elements look watercolor and soft. </p><p>  Applied embroidery uses cross-stitch alphabet patterns to create cubes.  First, the base of the product is made of fabric and soft filler, and a letter is made on the surface.  The toy helps in learning letters and making words. </p><h2>  Key Techniques </h2><p>  Embroidery usually uses a standard element, but using other details, you can diversify the product and make the plot more interesting.  To work with the use of cross-letter patterns, needlewomen are advised to use backstitch or back-needle stitching techniques.  It adds contour and distinctness to the finished embroidery and highlights individual elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="stillnomore.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross-stitch" class="if uuid-3134769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3134769.jpg"></div><p>  Half cross is used for background work, but can be used in the foreground in combination with the main element.  Different direction of stitches adds volume to the plot and helps to focus on specific details. </p><p>  French knots are used for spot embroidery.  Sewing technique can also be found in combination with a cross, due to which the elements become natural and sharper.  Also for this needlewomen can use a different composition of threads. </p><p>  As for how to embroider a cross, there is nothing complicated, because you just need to follow the cells of the canvas and in the process do not tighten the thread so that there are no gaps and holes.  Most schemes indicate the level of complexity, so you can choose the best option for yourself, given this criterion. </p><h2>  Scheme selection </h2><p>  Not only the complexity of the process, but also the result depends on this.  You can pay attention not only to foreign designs, but also to cross-letter patterns of domestic designers.  The alphabet is made in different fonts and with backstitch.  There are schemes of individual letters, near which beautiful animals or plants are placed.  Then each composition is sold as a separate scheme. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftown.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="letters with objects" class="if uuid-3134771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3134771.jpg"></div><p>  As for the cost, it depends on the level of complexity and the number of letters.  If this is the alphabet, then the scheme will cost from 200 to 400 rubles, if the development is a letter along with an addition, then it can be more expensive.  Monochrome options are cheaper because they are sewn faster, and in the process several shades of the same color are used. </p><h2>  Materials and quality </h2><p>  In addition to the scheme, you need to take care of the materials on which the embroidery will be made, because the final type of work depends on this.  If it will be applied, it is better to use the canvas, due to the cells you can cope faster and not lose count in the process.  On linen or <span>homespun fabric</span> metrics or stadiometers are embroidered.  Also, small plots will look more accurately on fabrics where the holes are small. </p><p>  If it is difficult to embroider on such a basis, then you can choose the outline of a shallow count, the quality of the result will be no worse than that embroidered on linen.  The splendor of the work and the saturation of the plot depend on the threads.  It is ideal to use DMC threads, but they are considered expensive, and the craftswomen replace them with cotton counterparts from China. </p><p>  Woolen threads give a good volume and create watercolors due to thick yarn, but it‚Äôs difficult to embroider a large plot, because they are often frayed or may fade after washing.  Silk threads or night-glowing threads can be used to decorate embroidered plots from letter patterns with a cross.  Their selection depends on the plot and type of embroidery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gntee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cartoon scheme" class="if uuid-3134774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3134774.jpg"></div><h2>  Needlewoman Tips </h2><p>  To make the work look neat and not overtightened, you need to use a hoop or an embroidery machine.  The second option is cumbersome and requires enough space for work, but very effective in terms of use.  Thanks to the tight tension, the crosses will be smoother and more accurate.  To speed up the process, you can use the parking method (for elements) or the technique for colors.  The second option is simpler and faster. </p><p>  In cross-stitch letters, you need to pay attention to the backstitch so that it is smooth and well conveys the bends of the contours.  The use of simple tips not only simplifies the process, but also makes work an order of magnitude easier and faster.  It will be more pleasant to do what you love if you place the diagram on the machine or attach it to the hoop, so you can take a comfortable position and quickly embroider the desired plot. </p>
