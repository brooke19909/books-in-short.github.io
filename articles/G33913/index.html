  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Organization as a system and its some functions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Organization and management is a system that is created to implement the tasks of a certain group of people.  Such a group can be represented as consisting of two subgroups: leaders, or owners, and hired personnel.  Based on this, two systemic, but at the same time opposite in tasks, functions are determined: realization of the goals of leaders and goals of hired personnel.  The interests of these two groups most often do not coincide, since one of the main tasks that the owners of the enterprise are trying to solve is minimizing costs, including the salaries of employees.  The tasks of hired personnel are directly opposite - workers try to minimize their energy, resource costs and at the same time receive the highest possible payment for their labor. </p><p>  If there are goals of leaders and hired personnel, even if they are oppositely directed, then the organization as a system will be in a certain state in which it can realize them.  However, in order for such a state to become more probable than any other, a resource is needed in the form of either energy, or matter, or information, or some mix of these three components.  To obtain the necessary resources, the organization as a system must exchange a certain product with the external environment.  The product most often combines energy, substance and information in different combinations.  Naturally, goods contain a greater amount of substance, while services contain either energy or information.  Now managers are increasingly trying to increase the degree of diversity of their product, that is, to diversify it by introducing all these three components into it.  Therefore, one more systemic function can be distinguished - product production. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Organization as a system exists in an ever-changing environment and is therefore inevitably exposed to it, and in response itself affects the objects around it.  Therefore, we can distinguish another system function - its interaction with the external environment. </p><p>  Thus, we have identified four basic system functions that almost any organization performs: interaction with the external environment;  realization of the goals of leaders;  product manufacturing;  realization of the goals of hired personnel. </p><p>  At different stages of the organization's development, the system functions that we consider in this article will have different meanings for it.  So, at the initial stage, the main such function will be the creation of the product, because, by implementing it, the enterprise receives the financial resources necessary for its development. </p><p>  Highlighting these basic functions will help us understand which groups of state factors will influence the development of strategic goals and objectives of the organization. <strong> </strong>  as <strong> </strong>  system.  These will likely be: </p><p>  1) a set of factors, the combination of which will realize the goals of leaders and personnel; </p><p>  2) factors in the presence of which the product production process can be realized; </p><p>  3) a group of factors by which the requirements of the external environment can be realized. </p><p>  Having defined the main functions, we can understand that the organization as a system consists of three managed subsystems that interact with each other: </p><p>  1) the subsystem, which is a management process, <strong> </strong>  connected <strong> </strong>  directly with the production of the product. </p><p>  2) a subsystem that controls the processes of interaction with a rapidly changing external environment; </p><p>  3) a subsystem that controls processes in which the goals of leaders and hired personnel can be realized. </p><p>  An approach of this kind will allow us to describe the organization through the interaction of the relevant subsystems, which will help to better understand its main problems and solve them more successfully. </p>
