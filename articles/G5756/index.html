And not only because this activity helps to relax and spend free time to good use, but also because the process itself raises the mood.  Bright colors used in beadwork allow you to create a truly chic work of art, such as a tree made of wisteria beads. </p><p>  It is imperative that you try to create such a tree yourself and understand that this is indeed a very pleasant and fascinating affair.  It is worth noting the moment that this tree made of wisteria beads will simply look perfect in the form of an artistic composition in which it will look perfectly harmonious. </p><p>  So how to make a <span>wisteria bead tree?</span>  At the very beginning of the work, it is necessary to prepare all the material required to create the composition.  First, you need wire and beads of various colors.  In this case, we will need two shades of green - a little darker and a little lighter, delicate pink, beautiful violet-lilac beads and a little yellow.  Also, to fasten parts and trim the trunk, you will need a dark floss thread, PVA glue, gypsum, various brushes and paints, a chisel, a hammer, a pallet on which the composition will be made, a helium candle and decor that will decorate the ground.  It can be various green moss, small pebbles and dried plants.  Everything that attracts and pleases the eye can be used in this composition. </p><p>  Now you need to figure out how to assemble a tree from beads.  First you need to complete the preparation of leaves and flowers.  Accordingly, the leaves are made from green beads, and the flowers are lilac.  This is done as follows: eight beads are put on the middle of the copper wire and clamped in a loop, then on each of the side leaves the number of beads should increase by two and be symmetrical to each other.  Thus, twigs with leaves wide at the beginning and narrow at the end of the leaf are obtained.  It is worth noting that the principle of weaving leaves and flowers of wisteria fully coincides.  And to make the tree more luxuriant, part of the harvested workpieces is made of more branches.  In total, to create a fluffy crown, you must prepare at least eighty blanks of green shades and at least sixty twigs of flowers.  The branches of the tree are collected only on the basis of personal taste.  All blanks are fastened with a thread. </p><p>  In order to learn how to make a tree from beads, you need to complete each step yourself.  The workpieces fastened with a thread are fixed on a copper wire in two or four pieces.  Blanks for twigs are ready, how to make a tree for beads next?  And the next step will be work on the creation of the main branches of wisteria.  There should be at least five.  To do this, you need a similar number of pieces of hard wire, to which, with the help of a thread, bead branches are tightly wound.  The ends of the wire wrap beautifully into a fancy trunk. </p><p>  Now you need to prepare the gypsum, install the tree on a pallet and pour this solution.  After the gypsum has hardened, it can be safely removed from the mold and proceed to the coating of the barrel, only the gypsum is now kneaded on the basis of glue.  After several layers of applying the composition, the tree needs to give time to dry and continue its decoration with paints.  Here you can give complete freedom to your imagination and draw not only a beautiful centuries-old trunk, but also a lake of wonderful azure color nearby.  Pebbles are laid on the bottom of the lake with glue, and the rest of the meadow around is covered with moss.  A helium candle is melted in a water bath and turns into clear lake water.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to make a tree from beads.  And in order for the composition to be fully completed, the lake can be decorated with beautiful water lilies from the remaining pink and yellow beads. </p>
