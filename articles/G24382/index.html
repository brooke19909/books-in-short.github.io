Even people could not spoil her pristine beauty.  Probably because the people living in it feel the uniqueness of the land on which they live.  No wonder Georgians are famous for their ability to enjoy every day they live. </p><p>  Particular charm is caused by the view of the most beautiful mountains and clean well-groomed beaches of Georgia.  At least once, but everyone must visit this country. </p><h2>  Ureki Beach </h2><p>  The Black-Black Sea has a black-black coast.  So a terrible story could begin, but in fact such a wonderful place really exists.  If you choose the best beaches in Georgia, then the coast of the climatic-balneological resort of Ureki will take one of the first places. </p>

    <p>  Located 50 km from the city of Batumi, it is known for its <span>black</span> magnetic <span>sand</span> far beyond the borders of the country.  But not only the healing properties of sand make it a great place to relax: </p><ul><li>  The length of the beach is almost 5 km, which allows you to freely sit on it even in high season. </li><li>  Immediately beyond the sand, the embankment begins, on which there are hotels of various categories, cafes, from which come the breathtaking aromas of Georgian cuisine, entertainment complexes and bungalows. </li><li>  Behind the embankment begins a broad forest belt running along the entire coast.  It mixes pines and eucalyptus trees, creating a unique healing air, which is the hallmark of the resort. </li><li>  The sea has a fairly wide scythe, which makes this beach safe for children to swim, since in order to reach the depths, you will have to move 200-300 meters from the coast. </li><li>  Clear water, numerous children's playgrounds and attractions attract couples with children to Ureki. </li></ul><p>  Being on this beach, it is recommended to lie directly on the sand, since the magnetic field that it creates has an amazing healing effect.  With its help they treat: cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal system, nervous system, childhood diseases - rickets, cerebral palsy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is not recommended to relax on the beach Ureki people with malignant tumors, tuberculosis, asthma and blood diseases. </p><h2>  Kobuleti </h2><p>  Maybe someone is attracted by the sandy beaches of Georgia, but the beach strewn with small pebbles, which are ‚Äúlicking‚Äù the gentle waves, is no less a pleasant place to relax.  The small resort town of Kobuleti is located 24 km from Batumi.  It is home to just over 20,000 inhabitants, most of whom are employed in the tourism industry. </p><p>  The subtropical climate with hot summers and warm winters allows you to relax in these places from May to October, and what is called the velvet season in other countries and falls in September starts here in November. </p>

    <p>  The beach in Kobuleti stretches for 10 km, and along it there is a promenade, which is divided into old and new parts.  The modern guests of the resort expect beautiful hotels, restaurants and entertainment, and the historical part attracts tourists with houses of old architecture. </p><p>  Like other beaches in Georgia, Kobuleti is suitable for families with young children, and pebbles of various shapes and colors will definitely appeal to them. </p><h2>  Poti Beach </h2><p>  Although this city is included in the resort category, it is also a large port, which leaves some imprint on its infrastructure and on the coast.  If you choose a vacation in Georgia, the beaches in Poti itself can hardly be called an ideal place, especially for couples with children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Although the city coast is constantly cleaned and the sea is clean enough, the noise made by the port does not create the impression of solitude with nature. </p><p>  Although Poti is not included in the ‚ÄúBest Beaches of Georgia‚Äù category, its suburbs have a great coast for relaxation.  There you can relax on the beach, strewn with small pebbles, although there are areas with sand and fairly large pebbles. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the tourist infrastructure is poorly developed, so it is not advisable to stay for a long time in Poti. </p><h2>  Batumi </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular resort cities in Georgia.  There are so many vacationers here in season that there is a need to come to the beach as early as possible in order to take a sunbed or a place by the water.  The coast here is pebble, so you should first familiarize yourself with what part of it is dominated by smaller pebbles, especially if you relax with children. </p><p>  Tourism here is developed no worse than in European resorts, so there is room to take a walk: a huge selection of restaurants and cafes, attractions, numerous shops with souvenirs, boutiques and markets, entertainment for children and nightlife - all this is Batumi. </p>

    <p>  The sea along the coast is ideal, as it is regularly cleaned.  For those who love solitude with nature, the beach at Cape Verde is suitable.  Particularly useful in this place will be a vacation for children.  The beach in Batumi itself is long - 7 km, and wide - up to 30 m, and stretches along the whole city, so it doesn‚Äôt matter in which part of the city to rent a hotel room, it‚Äôs all right, what‚Äôs called, at hand. </p><h2>  Gonio </h2><p>  For travelers who dream that only Georgia, the sea, the beach are around them, the coast near the small town of Gonio is suitable.  Here, even in the midst of the season, the closest neighbor ‚Äúon the towel‚Äù can be seen ten meters away. </p>

    <p>  Perhaps the reason is that the town is quite small, the beach infrastructure is completely undeveloped, the coast is covered with large pebbles, and there are no sunbeds on it.  But for those who prefer privacy to any comfort, which makes it possible to hear the surf and the cries of gulls, this place is ideal. </p><p>  Beautiful countryside, mountains surrounded by an alley of palm trees right behind the beach, clear water in the sea, the famous Gonio fortress - all this may become the reason for the development of tourism here in the future. </p><h2>  Kvariati </h2><p>  Although the beaches of Georgia are good, sand is not often found on them.  Here is the best coast in Adjara - Kvariati is also strewn with pebbles.  It is separated from other beaches by cliffs advancing directly to the sea, so it is quite secluded, although it is located only 15 km from Batumi. </p><p>  In addition to the cleanest sea and clean mountain air, this beach has great depth with a very rich underwater world.  It is here that the only diving center in Georgia is located, where you can go through the basics of scuba diving and rent the necessary equipment. </p><p>  Like the other popular beaches of Georgia, in Kvariati it will not be difficult to find accommodation in one of the hotels located right outside the beach or in the private sector even during the season.  The only drawback of this place is that it is not suitable for families with children.  Large depths of water are dangerous, and large pebbles are unlikely to please small legs. </p><h2>  Savage vacation </h2><p>  It would be strange to forget about the rest ‚Äúsavage‚Äù, which is still to the liking of many travelers.  Shekvetili beach is the most suitable for living in a tent, which, like Ureki, is covered with black magnetic sand. </p>

    <p>  On the coast there is a toilet and shower, and tents can be set up right on the shore.  A gentle descent into the sea, the presence of pine forest, cleanliness and silence will be an excellent place for a family vacation with children. </p><p>  These are not all the beaches of Georgia, but the most famous and interesting of them. </p>
