Club luminaries compete with newcomers for customers using all available methods.  Visitors are lured by performances by invited stars, <span>famous DJs,</span> discounts at the bar, contests and entry promotions. </p><p>  But all the same, a certain gradation of such institutions is preserved, which varies in terms of the public and pricing policy.  In this article we will consider the top clubs in Kiev. </p><h2>  10. Club "Greenwich" </h2><p>  The rating of clubs in Kiev opens an old institution, which began work about 6 years ago.  Mostly those clubbers who have little money for such entertainment are attracted here.  Face control is conditional here: all people who are able to pay entry enter here.  Consequently, the audience is very motley, mostly quite young - up to 25 years old.  At the same time, prices are affordable, an order of magnitude lower than in similar establishments located on Khreshchatyk. </p>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, the club does not differ in sophistication, does not indulge in the novelty of the musical repertoire: hits of the 80s play here, although there are performances by various invited DJs.  The club is located in the basement.  Its interior is not distinguished by originality - a low ceiling, 2 bar counters, and also a dance floor for 600 people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  9. Club "Saxon" </h2><p>  Considering the clubs of Kiev, reviews of which are presented in this article, one can not help but mention one of the favorite institutions of students of Shevchenko University.  Saxon is located in the <span>Goloseevsky district,</span> near the place of permanent residence of students.  It is unlikely that anyone would dare to come here from the center, as can be found in the reviews. </p><p>  Music - pop, electro, R'n'B, as well as DJ performances.  The institution consists of two floors.  At the same time, the interior is: a wooden staircase, high ceilings and balconies.  The club is equipped with a stage, two dance floors and bar counters. </p><h2>  8. The Fast and the Furious Club </h2><p>  This is a proven place respected by several generations of metropolitan disco lovers.  Its main feature is the eighties parties, to which people come from all over the city, which few Kiev clubs can boast of. </p>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, the main visitors of the Fast and the Furious are also students.  Music - trance, hits of the 80s, R'n'B, pop, performances of DJs.  The facility consists of a private balcony and three floors.  The interior is not original: it is made of wood, there is a stage, balconies, the ceiling height pleases, there are two dance floors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  7. Club "On the area" </h2><p>  This institution was opened relatively recently in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTroieschina.  Local residents come here, as the club is located quite far from the center.  Entrance here is almost always free until 23.00.  Such a nice bonus is not offered by all Kiev clubs. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the music here is R'n'B, pop, DJ performances.  The institution is two-story.  Interior: sports bar, two bar counters, sushi bar, dance floor. </p><h2>  6. Club "Party Room" </h2><p>  We continue to consider the clubs of Kiev.  "Party Room" began its work recently.  But immediately this place became incredibly popular among Kievans, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  This is not surprising: the institution is located next to the more pretentious club Arena, but it is much less demanding on visitors.  Therefore, there is always a huge number of young people. </p>

    <p>  The age of the public varies within the category of up to 30 years, of which many students.  Music - R'n'B, pop.  The club is small.  Interior - 2 small halls, a bar, low ceilings, two dance areas. </p><h2>  5. Club "Patipa" </h2><p>  Previously, he was considered one of the best clubs in the capital.  But over the past few years it has deteriorated somewhat and is no longer breathing in the back of the head with such expensive, sophisticated establishments as Arena or Dynamo Lux. </p><p>  Despite the fresh repairs and various features, such as ballet, promotions, DJs, most of the regulars left him, which is easy to guess from the reviews.  At the same time, entry lines are still lined up on Fridays, which not all Kiev clubs can rejoice at.  Music - R'n'B, pop, DJ sets. </p><p>  The institution is large, consists of two floors (privileged area and a common dance floor).  Interior: roomy dance floor, 3 bar counters, high ceilings. </p><h2>  4. Club "Sorry, Grandma" </h2><p>  There, where this institution works now, before that there were several clubs, although they closed quite quickly.  However, this disco bar has become very popular.  Especially there are many foreigners.  The reviews say that sometimes there is a feeling that foreign delegations come here to rest after their congresses. </p>

There is a large round bar, roomy dance floor, soft sofas. </p><h2>  3. Club "DeLux" </h2><p>  One of the most expensive clubs in the capital, as can be judged by the reviews.  Wealthy clubbers of Kiev, businessmen, wealthy foreigners gather here, in the lounge bar there is an opportunity to see local celebrities, as well as the political elite. </p><p>  A column of Mercedes, Lexus and other executive cars is lined up every weekend before entering the establishment.
