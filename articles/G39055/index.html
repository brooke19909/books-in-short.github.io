    <p>  Now about the most necessary - about food.

Poolside Pool Bar serves tea, coffee, soft drinks, and strong drinks and cocktails. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  The management of the Vinh Suong Seaside hotel has not forgotten about the children either - an equipped playground is open for them, and if parents need to go somewhere, the nanny will sit with the child for a moderate fee.  The hotel has a shallow children's pool, and the restaurant will be comfortable for kids in special high chairs.  If an extra bed is required in the room, it will be provided upon request. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visit the hotel always express very different opinions, and our hotel was not an exceptional case.  The reviews were different, and often they depended on which building the hotel guests lived in. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vinh suong seaside 3 vietnam reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30568/752226.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Those who were accommodated in the buildings noted that one of them lacked balconies, and this turned out to be inconvenient in terms of drying clothes and towels for some guests who did not read the guide very carefully.  But the serviceability of all television channels was unanimously noted by all (the hotel is equipped mainly with LG TVs).  Some rooms do not have safes - it is proposed to store things at the <span>reception, this</span> point should also be taken into account when checking into the hotel. </p><p>  Of course, if you are going to visit Vinh Suong Seaside 3 * <span>(Vietnam),</span> hotel <span>reviews</span> will help to make the first invisible impression of the place, but you need to focus not only on them.  Check with the tour operator all questions of interest so that then the vacation does not turn out to be spoiled.  By the way, not a single case of theft or loss of documents or valuables in the entire history of the hotel was recorded. <br>  There were no complaints about the cleanliness of the rooms - every day the staff carried out a good cleaning, and linen and towels were changed once every three days.  Guests noted a not too large hotel area, but it was clean and well maintained.  Tourists living in a bungalow with a terrace were delighted.  The excellent condition of furniture and textiles (linen and towels) was noted. </p><p>  As for the breakfasts served in the hotel complex, the not so great variety of dishes was compensated by their wonderful taste.  The hotel chefs were very praised.  But in general, tourists are advised to eat all at once in restaurants near the hotel: the cost of dishes compared to Russian counterparts is simply ridiculous - a dinner for two can cost as little as 300 rubles!  The dishes are fresh, unusual for Russians, but tasty.  By the way, shops with souvenirs and alcohol are found at every step. </p><p>  Many guests were very pleased with the free 24-hour Wi-Fi connection throughout the hotel, as well as the service - very thorough and respectful. </p><p>  Party-goers will not like the hotel, if only because of its location - the city of Phan Thiet does not have fun and youth recreation.  It is ideal to spend a relaxing vacation with young children, without making unnecessary requests.  The hotel has everything you need, but no frills.  For everyone who wants to travel, there is the opportunity to consult a guide on how to get to local attractions.  The minus of the hotel guests considered lack of knowledge of the Russian language and poor knowledge of English. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Tourists who come to any hotel usually expect attention, participation from the staff, and also want to expect to receive at least the minimum amenities for their stay.  The hotel described in the article has all this.  Despite the three-star category, the budget hotel Vinh Suong Seaside 3 * leaves quite a good impression.  Reviews about him are mostly positive.  Indeed, the hotel grounds are beautiful and well-groomed, all without exception, guests were pleased with the clean beach and sea, as well as delicious breakfasts at the hotel.  Finally, the hotel guests were grateful to the staff for their attentiveness, friendliness and help in everything. </p>
