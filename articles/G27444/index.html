Pets are not allowed. </p><h2>  Guest Impressions </h2><p>  The authors of the reviews amicably express their dissatisfaction with this hotel, calling it not appropriate for the declared 3 * category.  The hotel, guests are divided, everything is very old: furniture, equipment, technical equipment.  Repair was not done here for a very long time.  In some places stucco streams on the heads of vacationers or water drips.  Of the four elevators, one works, which has to wait a long time, standing in long lines.  The rooms, although very tidy, are also too old to be repaired.  There are cases when lizards and cockroaches crawled into the rooms to the residents.  Breakfast is very good, varied and tasty, guests share.  The assortment of the bar is rather meager. </p><p>  Both in Triton and Neptune, tourists are faced with inconveniences and troubles of a very different plan: inadequate neighbors, equipment breakdown in the room, lack of air conditioning with windows boarded up with nails in the heat, etc.  A big inconvenience for many travelers is the lack of the Internet, which is often unavailable even with cards.  Reviewers do not recommend choosing Neptuno Triton 3 * for a long stay for travelers who value comfort. </p>
