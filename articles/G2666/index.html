The climatic conditions of this region make it incredibly popular among tourists who prefer a beach holiday.  Bulgaria is called the "Pearl of the Balkans".  One of the best resorts in the country is Sunny Beach.  The name of this place comes from its natural warmth and almost always reigning sunny weather on the Black Sea.  Those who want to spend an active family or youth holiday will find everything you need for this, there are entertainment and sports events.  All of them are more concentrated on the <span>coast of Sunny Beach.</span> </p><p>  For a short period of time, the resort really liked the tourists, and every year there are more and more people wishing to visit it.  There is a huge number of hotels, campsites, restaurants, bars and nightlife.  The peculiarity of this place is pale golden sand, which is strewn with an 8 km long beach in the shape of an arc.  The coastal zone is washed by the translucent water of a warm gulf.  Protected by natural undulating dunes, the beach area is awarded the Blue Flag. </p><p>  Everyone can find rest for the soul and afford.  It has clean beaches, friendly locals and vibrant clubs.  I am glad that housing at the resort is available even to budget tourists.  Hotels are located directly on the Black Sea.  Entertainment at reasonable prices, a variety of cocktails and drinks, the staff of the institutions is very pleasant and professional. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As already noted, the beach stretches as much as 8 km.  The local sand is very nice to walk and play with the children.  Even the most sensitive person will be comfortable in contact with soft sand dunes, on which, by the way, you can have fun with children, playing hide and seek.  Parents can not worry about their child, near the shore there is a shallow bottom, which will allow kids to play.  For those who want to spend time comfortably on the beach there are sun loungers on which you can relax and enjoy the sunshine.  Those who prefer to sunbathe on a sandy beach can bring their own rugs and sit under specially equipped umbrellas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Bulgaria there are a lot of various hotel complexes of various levels.

The latter are not of very good quality, so if possible it is better to purchase instant tea or coffee.  Of the fruits, there are often watermelons, melons.  The sausages are tasteless, but other dishes can satisfy your hunger.  During the day, you can eat in local restaurants and cafes for little money.  You can also purchase products in supermarkets.  There is an opportunity to pay extra for dinners at a local restaurant, but this is often unprofitable, since vacationers do not like to be attached to a place on vacation. </p><h2>  Staff Opinions </h2><p>  Hotel service reviews called neutral.  Here, no one is showing their emotions too much.  The work is done efficiently.  In case of unforeseen situations, the staff goes to the rescue and resolves all issues.  A particularly rare quality that is present in the local mentality is honesty.  Nobody will take anything superfluous from you.  Even if this happened by chance, everyone will be returned with an apology. </p><p>  Problems with the placement also does not arise.  The rooms are cleaned with high quality.  Towels are changed every three days, bed linen - once a week. </p><h2>  Contingent </h2><p>  Hotel Tia Maria ("Tia Maria") 3 * often stops family people with children.  You can meet here both the elderly and the young.  In general, the hotel is designed for any age category.  Even when noisy young people return to the hotel in the morning, this does not cause inconvenience.  There is a little discomfort, but the rooms are well soundproofed and practically no noise is heard. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Guided tours are offered at the hotel itself.  You can select the appropriate route.  Dry breakfasts are available upon request.  Tourists are advised to visit the lovely town of Nessebar.  Here you can buy delicious wine. </p><p>  In Bulgaria, you can only pay with local currency - leva.  Money is best changed in banks.
