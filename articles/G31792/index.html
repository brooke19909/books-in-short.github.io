Simple but miraculous recommendations will make naive - wise, and defenseless and insecure - experienced connoisseurs in the question: "What if the phone does not charge?"  Most likely, even people who are not technically savvy will be able to adequately answer the presumptuous ‚Äúguru‚Äù from an independent workshop that the cause of the malfunction lies not in the red button and not even in the fact that the beloved dog likes to play with the hanging charger cord (charger).  After all, everything that can be done at home will be known to you, and this, believe me, is not enough.  Put aside the lyrics and move on from words to practice. </p><h2>  Why the phone does not charge: the main reasons and methods for eliminating them </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to do if the phone does not charge?" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/676920.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><p>  As a rule, such a malfunction occurs as a result of mechanical or chemical exposure.  However, you cannot discount the software failure of a mobile device.  Even such a modern phenomenon as ‚Äúelectronic malware infection‚Äù can cause a malfunction in the power supply system of the smartphone.  Nevertheless, correctly performed diagnostics will dot all i. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Is your <span>charger</span> working properly <span>?</span> </h2><p>  If the phone stops charging, first of all, you should visually inspect the power cord of <span>the power adapter.</span>  You may find obvious signs of damage to the outer insulation of the cable.  Deformation in the form of excesses and extension also should not hide from your sight.  If everything is normal with the wire, but the plug has not oxidized, contact your neighbors, acquaintances or a colleague for help, maybe one of them has exactly the same charge.  A positive result - go to the store and buy a new memory, no - proceed further. </p><h2>  In addition: USB check </h2><p>  As a rule, a mobile device purchased in a store has a synchronization cord (DATA cable) in its kit.  Connect the cellular device to the computer.  <span>Does your phone not charge</span> via USB? </p>

    <p>  Disconnect all <span>peripherals</span> from the PC.  No reaction?  The situation is bad, but it‚Äôs too early to get upset, there are several more methods with which you can try to restore the ‚Äúenergy life‚Äù of the mobile phone. </p><h2>  Software failure and what the virus is capable of </h2><p>  Often, owners of smartphones sin by installing various programs and applications that expand the capabilities of the device.  Moreover, without even thinking about the ‚Äúdecency‚Äù of the developers and not attaching importance to the nuance that the source of distribution is filled with extremely dubious content.  As a result, the working firmware begins to ‚Äúfail‚Äù.  The charge indication may stop working at all, and with the virus that has invaded, the phone will quickly lose its once-lasting battery charge for two or three days.  Please note if any of the wireless modules spontaneously turns on.  Found a snag - uninstall the program and neutralize the malicious code. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Mobile device <span>power connector</span> </h2><p>  Remember: never panic when deciding the question "what to do if the phone does not charge": this can always be fixed. </p><p>  In bright light (and if there is a magnifying glass, it‚Äôs absolutely wonderful) examine the inside of the nest.  "Chic and shine" is a great sign!  Pollution and chemical plaque in the form of oxidation requires purification. </p><p>  Remember the saying "the farther into the forest, the more firewood"?  So, do not try hard to pick the narrow channel of the contact connector with various improvised means - you can still damage the whole system element.  Caution, a thin brush and alcohol are all that you need in this case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why is my phone not charging?" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/676922.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A good solution to the question ‚ÄúWhat to do if the phone does not charge‚Äù is a simple experiment.  Insert a known-good memory into the socket of the mobile device and without obvious efforts shake the plug in different directions with a frequency of one second.  The indication came to life - to your workshop, ‚Äúdull‚Äù - we read the next paragraph. </p><h2>  Accumulator battery </h2><p>  If the battery‚Äôs energy supply is completely exhausted, it is likely that the autonomous battery has lost its starting impulse.  In such a situation, universal memory is simply indispensable. </p><ul><li>  Install the battery in the latch and, observing the polarity, apply electricity to the plus and minus contacts. </li><li>  Literally after 5-10 minutes, the battery can be inserted into the phone. </li></ul><p>  If all to no avail and the miracle did not happen, then the next stage of the project ‚Äúwhat to do if the phone does not charge‚Äù will be a trip to the nearest workshop or service center. </p><h2>  Natural Finale </h2><p>  The fall of the phone and a hit on a hard surface, even when it is shockproof ‚Äúfrom birth‚Äù, does not lead to anything good.  As they say, luck is a temporary phenomenon.  As a result of this kind of mechanical damage, the owner of the mobile device may encounter the following problem that the phone does not charge - charging is in progress.  Often, due to a strong blow, the battery of a mobile phone fails.  The visually observable indication is actually just software graphics, which essentially works in vain.  Since battery capacities do not charge.  There are two ways out: either repair the power controller of the cellular device, or replace the battery.  In the first case, you just can‚Äôt do without masters. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The phone stopped charging" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/676921.jpg" width="248"></div></h2><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Let's hope that the question of why the phone does not charge is resolved for you today.  Nevertheless, I would like to give you some recommendations as an encouragement for curiosity: </p><ul><li>  Do not use the <span>universal charger</span> too often <span>.</span> </li><li>  Do not allow deep battery discharges to zero. </li><li>  Do not leave the phone in the heat or, conversely, in the cold. </li><li>  Install anti-virus protection on your phone (if the software allows it). </li></ul><p>  Have a nice day and a successful repair! </p>
