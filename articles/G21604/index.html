  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vladimir Krasnoe Solnyshko</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The end of the seventies of the 10th century was marked by the arrival on the princely throne in Kiev of the youngest son of Svyatoslav - Vladimir.  <span>The personal qualities of the</span> new ruler, his character attracted people to him.  During his reign, he knew how to talk with ordinary people, took care of the sick, gave out gifts, not distinguishing himself at the same time and sometimes being arrogant and unjust.  For the wide soul, his hospitality, along with educational, creative and general activities, the ruler received the nickname "Red Sun".  The youngest son of Svyatoslav became a hero of epics and legends. </p><p>  Vladimir Krasnoye Solnyshko, whose biography is full of various events, ruled for almost forty years.  The main event during his reign is, of course, the adoption of Christianity and the Baptism of Russia.  It happened in 988. </p><p>  Having ascended the throne, <span>Prince Vladimir the</span> Red Sun began to think about strengthening power.  He began to build pagan sanctuaries and establish idols everywhere.  Being in exile, the Vikings relied on their strength.  In addition, the Slavs at that time, venerating the gods of Perun, Simargl, Veles and others, lived according to the laws of paganism. </p><p>  In the first ten years, Vladimir the Red Sun established a wooden idol of the chief, in his opinion, god Perun in front of the prince's tower.  According to chronicles, idolatry was most widespread precisely at the beginning of the reign of the young ruler. </p><p>  In order to strengthen the state, Vladimir Krasnoye Solnyshko made a large number of trips to neighboring territories.  After the declaration of war by the Polish Slavs, the young ruler captured some fortified cities and annexed Red Russia (Carpathian region).  After traveling to the northeast, he pacified those who did not want to pay tribute to the Vyatichi.  From there, Vladimir Krasnoe Solnyshko headed northwest, on the territory of an ancient tribe of Lithuanians - the state of the Yatvyag. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Several evidence has survived about how and where the baptism of the ruler of Kievan Rus took place.  According to some sources, this event happened in Kiev itself, according to others - in the city of Vasilev (in the Kiev region). </p><p>  Some evidence calls Korosten (Khersones) the city of Vladimir‚Äôs baptism.  The Russian ruler organized another campaign to these territories.  In those days, this Crimean fortress belonged to Byzantium and resisted the invasion of Vladimir for a long time.  According to legend, the <span>ruler of Russia</span> made a vow to be baptized in case the fortress was taken by him.  After a long resistance, the inhabitants of Korosteni were forced to surrender.  However, this was not enough for the Kiev prince. </p><p>  After the capture of the fortress, Vladimir sends a warning to Constantinople, then ruling Konstantin and Vasily, that he is ready to go to the capital of Byzantium.  At the same time, the Russian prince agreed to peace, if he got Anna, the sister of the Byzantine rulers, as his wife.  However, the brothers considered it indecent to pass off their Christian sister as an idolater, which the prince diplomatically hinted at, proposing to adopt Christianity.  Together with the acceptance of their faith, the Byzantine rulers promised to surrender to Anna.  The Russian prince went to such conditions. </p><p>  After his baptism, Vladimir baptized his children, a large number of noble and ordinary people of Kiev.  He ordered idols to be dumped into the Dnieper. </p><p>  Over the next 25 years, more than 300 Orthodox churches were built on the territory of Kievan Rus, which became centers for the spread of Christian culture. </p><p>  Together with Orthodoxy, both writing and book education came to Russia.  After baptism in the state there are schools in which priests teach. </p><p>  The subsequent reign of Vladimir was associated with the safe existence and unity of Kievan Rus.  He made hikes in the North Caucasus, to the <span>Caspian Sea,</span> to the Volga.  Defensive lines were erected at the new borders of the state, cities, fortresses, signal towers, earthen ramparts were built.  Thus, fortresses were built on the Trubezh, Desna and other rivers. </p><p>  <span>Prince Vladimir of Kiev</span> died in Berestov, July 15, 1015 from a sudden illness, without electing the heir to the throne. </p>
