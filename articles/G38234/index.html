    <p>  Mysterious places on Earth.  Where to find them?  Just look around.  In every corner of the planet you can find interesting and unusual natural phenomena.  The question is different: what do you want more - beauty, mesmerizing spirit, or all the same extreme adventure?  Seekers of beauty should visit, for example, Salyar de Uyuni in Bolivia.  A huge salt desert was formed on the site of a dried lake.  In the rainy season, when the salt is covered with a small layer of water, it feels like a person is walking on water.  The sky merges with the earth.  All thoughts disappear overnight.  This is the most incredible place on Earth! </p><p>  And there are also such natural corners, visiting which it will be difficult to fall asleep.  Caves, forests and lakes with mysterious and mystical stories will not leave indifferent even the most daring and brave tourists.  Horror films will seem like children's fairy tales.  Anomalous places of the planet will tickle the nerves of everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dedicated to thrill lovers </h2><p>  Blue hole.  This is an underwater cave, which is located on the coast of Belize among coral reefs (Central America).  It is a funnel 120 meters deep and 305 wide.  The cave arch collapsed and was flooded when the sea level rose.  The blue hole became known to the world after the telecasts of the researcher Jacques-Yves Cousteau.  It was he who became the pioneer of this amazing natural phenomenon.  The underwater world of the cave is very diverse, which attracts divers.  Feeling as if you are in a cartoon about the mermaid Ariel. </p><p>  <span>Underground rivers</span> and lakes are undoubtedly the most unusual places.  There are many such people on the planet.  And, of course, Lake Melissano in Greece deserves special attention.  This is a cave and a lake at the same time.  Clean as tears, water combined with virgin thickets and unusual stones - what could be more beautiful?  The only thing missing is the fairytale nymphs and elves. </p><p>  The underground river Puerto Princess in the Philippines attracts and fascinates.  The largest underground river in the world.  Its length reaches eight kilometers.  Puerto Princess is one of the wonders of nature.  The area around the underground reservoir, as well as the reservoir itself, are declared a national park.  You can get into the cave directly from the open sea, where the river flows.  Maybe this is the most mysterious place on Earth? </p>

    <p>  So, where are they - the mysterious places of the planet?  Photos of natural wonders can be found on the pages of various encyclopedias.  It is enough to look through one of these books and decide on the travel route.  You should definitely see the Giants Road in Ireland, the Troll Language in Norway, canyons in the USA, Spotted Lakes in Canada, and much, much more. </p><p>  The Road of the Giants.  It is laid out on the coast of Ireland from stone columns.  Many legends and legends exist on her account.  The most common legend: one Finn built the road to fight the sea monster.  In fact, the trail was formed due to volcanic eruptions.  The area where it is located is a nature reserve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Antelope Canyon in the USA.  America is rich in canyons, but the most amazing is Antelope Canyon.  In the photo he looks like a human creation.  After all, how can nature fashion such lines and shapes?  Can!  Winds and rainwater for a long time carved out and washed sand caves.  It is difficult to name all the shades of the canyon.  In the morning he is alone, in the evening another.  And the best play of colors is in the afternoon, in the sunlight.  The canyon is located on the lands of the Navajo tribe.  And to see the most mysterious place on Earth, you need to pay the Indians for crossing their land. </p><p>  Spotty Lake in Canada.  The shape of the lake resembles a honeycomb, each cell of which is filled with water of a different color.  This is because the reservoir is saturated with various minerals, which color the water.  In summer, water evaporates, leaving beneficial minerals on the surface. </p><p>  Stone Forest in China.  These are amazing stones resembling small mountains.  At one time there was a sea that washed soft rocks, leaving stone trunks.  The forest is located in Yunnan and is very popular among tourists.  It has narrow paths and passages that are better not to wander alone - you can get lost.  Similar formations exist in Russia on the banks of the Lena River (Yakutia). </p>

    <p>  The pyramids of Yoganuni in Japan.  The world knows many pyramids, but the Japanese were discovered recently, only 20 years ago.  The peculiarity of the buildings is that they are under water.  According to scientists, the <span>age of the pyramids</span> is ten thousand years.  There are no clear answers who and how built this artifact.  However, terraces, trenches, various lines and inscriptions testify to a certain, perhaps still unknown, civilization that was flooded by the sea. </p><p>  Loving tourists should definitely visit the Tunnel of lovers.  It is located in the Rivne region in Ukraine.  An abandoned railway, it would seem, should have a frightening, mystical appearance.  But with this tunnel the opposite is true!  In summer, the railway section is overgrown with greenery on all sides and takes the form of a tunnel.  Many lovers and newlyweds hurry here for a photo shoot.  The tunnel is very similar to the path from the fairy tale "Alice in Wonderland."  So you are waiting for the Cheshire Cat to appear ... </p><h2>  A bit of horror stories.  Ghost towns </h2><p>  In addition to stunning and mysterious natural corners, our planet is full of terrible and unpleasant places that chill the soul with their mystical secrets.  As they say, horror films "rest" in comparison with them.  Thrill seekers - just right! </p><p>  In the category of ‚Äúmost abnormal places‚Äù the first place can be legally given to Ukraine and its ghost town of Pripyat.  The city was abandoned and abandoned after the world famous tragedy at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.  Empty streets, playgrounds and lonely houses seemed to be specially created as scenery for a creepy film.  Pripyat is the youngest ghost town.  At the time of the disaster, he was only 16 years old.  Now there are about 300 old-timers who did not want to seek shelter in other cities. </p><p>  There is a similar town in Russia - Kadychkan (Magadan).  It dates back to 1943, when high-quality coal deposits were discovered at the site of the future settlement.  Since then, a small village has been laid.  However, after a mine explosion in 1996, life in the city became impossible due to the increased level of radiation.  People stunted before our eyes.  The evacuation began.  Now only empty apartments and abandoned cars in the courtyards remind us that the city ‚Äúwas‚Äù ... </p>

    <p>  Oradour-sur-Glan - a French village, whose inhabitants were shot by German invaders during the Second World War.  642 people were killed in one day, of which nearly 500 were women and children.  The city itself was burned.  Not far from the place of the tragedy, a new city with the same name was built, and the old Oradour-sur-Glan recognized as a historical monument. </p><p>  There is also in America its own ghost town - Detroit (Michigan).  The formerly thriving city now looks like a ghost: ruined houses and schools inspire fear and horror.  The most impressive was once the largest railway station in the world.  Detroit is a great place to shoot mystical films.  In abandoned churches, dolls testifying to satanic rites are scattered everywhere. </p><p>  Ghost towns are the most unusual places on the planet.  They make you think about the consequences of human actions and reconsider your attitude to nature. </p><h2>  In search of the paranormal </h2><p>  When it comes to ghost towns, it is appropriate to mention the individual buildings, which are so scary in their appearance.  The paranormal places of the planet are not a game of the imagination of the directors, they are true stories that deserve attention. </p><p>  Amityville.  Someone will say: ‚ÄúThis is just fiction!‚Äù  But still, a strange house really exists!  Amityville is located near New York.  The murder, which entailed mysterious events, has not been solved to this day.  No one knows what really happened there.  However, after a terrible incident, when the eldest son killed his whole family, not a single tenant stayed in the house for a long time.  People fled leaving their belongings. </p><p>  The psychiatric clinic Lier Sikehus in Norway or the military hospital in Germany also cause the same horror.  Buildings that have a dark past will be a godsend for lovers of the paranormal.  In the clinic, as well as in the hospital, souls who died in agony and agony found their refuge. </p><p>  Alone with notes of mysticism, the eighth workshop of the Dagdiesel plant (Russia) "smacks of"  This is a Russian military station in the Caspian Sea.  It is located three kilometers from the coast.  The walls of a long-abandoned factory, like a cold iceberg, stand in the middle of the sea and scare the marines with their monstrous appearance ... </p>

    <p>  Russia has its own Silent Hill.  A small abandoned town of cottages and children's camps is located in the Moscow region.  And God forbid to witness the satanic rites that are held there! </p><h2>  Roads of death </h2><p>  Our land is braided by roads and highways.  There are good highways and not so.  And there are trails, the stay on which inexplicably gives rise to fear. </p><p>  For example, the <span>Death Road in Bolivia.</span>  The scariest road in the world!  She claimed thousands of lives.  The road runs high in the mountains and stretches for 70 km.  On one side are cliffs dotted with crosses and monuments, and on the other hand, a cliff and precipice.  And although the construction of a safe path has begun, they still use this road.  Eyewitnesses more than once noticed strange white shadows, flickering either in front or behind the car.  Probably the souls of the dead on this trail, which can not find rest in any way ... </p><p>  An unusual road is in the mountains of China.  This is not just a track, but a tunnel road.  Periodically, the route seems to enter the mountain itself, where on the one hand there are rocks, and on the other there are such windows over a precipice.  They say that if the driver looks out that window, he will immediately fall down ... </p><p>  There is a road of death in Russia.  This is the name of the Lyubertsy-Lytkarino highway.  This is a narrow winding highway on which drivers drive with extreme caution.  Strange silhouettes were seen by more than one traveler.  Rumor has it that in these places there are ancient burials.  Perhaps restless souls seek answers to their eternal questions.  The whole road is dotted with monuments, crosses and flowers. </p><p>  And by and large, all the roads of Russia in one way or another can be called the death paths.  Either the drivers are such, or the highways, but the Russian Federation is among the first countries in road accidents. </p><h2>  Paranormal Russia </h2><p>  The whole Russian country is teeming with anomalies.  A lot of different oddities in her very heart - in Moscow and the region.  Abnormal places near Moscow are scattered mainly in small villages. </p><p>  UFO seekers can hunt for unusual pictures in the settlements of Chapel, Protasovo, Ogudnevo, Nikolskoye and many others.  The most powerful geopathic site is in the village of Chapel.  Strange sounds, shadows and flashes have been repeatedly noticed by local residents.  Some were lucky to shoot interesting shots on the camera, the authenticity of which was verified in Russia and the USA. </p><p>  Often, lights are fixed in the sky at 47 km of the Yaroslavl highway, in particular, over the village of Sofrino.  You can find out if this is true or true only by armed with a camera and going on an extreme trip. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about Moscow itself, then almost every metro station hides some secrets.  The underground stations Baumanskaya (Basurmansky crypts), Sukharevskaya (Tower of the sorcerer), Chistye Prudy (skryazh with Myasnitskaya) hide a lot of interesting and paranormal things.  These are the places that still keep the secrets of the past. </p><p>  But the biggest horror is causing Beria House on Malaya Nikitskaya Street (metro Arbatskaya) to residents of Moscow.  They say that at night they hear the sounds of a car drove up, followed by heavy men's steps.  This is Beria returned home.  And well, if he is accompanied by a lady.  But if you can hear the groans of the repressed, then it is better to run away from that place without looking back ... </p><h2>  What do the caves of Russia hide? </h2><p>  Caves are the most mysterious places of the planet, which from ancient times have caused increased interest in people.  Different beliefs and legends exist about these natural creations. </p><p>  For example, Sablinsky caves in the Leningrad region took more than one human life.  They prefer to be silent about this place.  You cannot read about it in the newspaper and you will not hear on the radio.  The secret zone is covered in secrets that no one has yet been able to solve.  Previously, fugitives and prisoners hid in caves.  Probably, they could not find a way out of them, and now their souls are doomed to eternal search. </p><p>  Many horror stories are connected with the Kashlukat cave in the north of Russia.  It is popularly known as the cave of the Black Devil.  It is not surprising, because its grottoes also have mystical names - Skeleton, Obscurantism ... On the walls of the cave you can see the ancient spells of shamans, who for a long time held their rites here.  They say that those who managed to survive after going to the cave go crazy over time. </p>

    <p> The most abnormal and mysterious places of Russia are enclosed in mountain ranges.  One of these is the <span>Mountain of the Dead,</span> or the Dyatlov Pass.  Many people learned about this place from the movie of the same name.  This is not just an invention of the director, it is a real mountain, and it is located in the north of the Urals.  Back in 1959, a group of young tourists tried to conquer it.  However, all members of the group died under mysterious circumstances.  Rescuers looking for tourists found only a tent torn from the inside.  What force made people leave the place of overnight in severe frost?  What scared the band members so much?  There are still no clear answers to these questions.  Locals consider this place damned. </p><h2>  They don‚Äôt talk about such places ... </h2><p>  ‚ÄúUnusual places on the planet, photos of which can be found on the pages of educational books, are just pictures,‚Äù everyone will say.  And only those who feel the cold of a mysterious cave or lake on themselves will hardly want to visit these corners again. </p><p>  There are areas in Russia that are better not to be aware of, and especially not to go there.  For example, the Devil's Cemetery, local residents prefer to bypass the tenth road.  The mystical forest with an incomprehensible clearing is located near the village of Ust-Kov, Kezhemsky District, Krasnodar Territory. </p>

    <p>  According to the legend of the villagers, in 1908 a meteorite fell here, which formed a <span>huge hole</span> in the ground.  The hole later overgrown.  But the land at this place is considered damned.  She looks like after a terrible fire, and there is nothing alive on her.  Everyone who stepped on the Devil's Cemetery will immediately die.  For all the years of research, about a hundred people disappeared here. </p><p>  These are far from all the anomalous places of Russia.  Many secrets are hidden in the water bodies of the country. </p><p>  Ivachevsky lake (Volgograd region).  The reservoir fascinates with its beauty and mystery.  However, the picturesque area not only pacifies, but also catches up some fear.  Many noted that after rest on this lake their health worsened.  And residents of the city of Cherepovets, which is located next to the lake, say that more and more people are disappearing in this reservoir.  Researchers of anomalies do not yet give clear answers.  This is the most mysterious place on Earth. </p><p>  Bypass also the Yachenskoe reservoir (Kaluga region).  The people call him the Thunder of the Lord.  The reservoir attracts an electric charge.  People bathing in it die from lightning strikes.  Better not to be in these places.  It is unlikely that someone will enjoy such a vacation. </p><p>  But the mortality of people in the lake Sursi of the Arkhangelsk region is understandable.  The reservoir is life threatening due to increased radioactivity.  The fish here pops up belly, and the fishermen completely disappear.  Those who managed to survive after such fishing remember events with fear and do not always survive until the morning.  The results of forensic examinations show that the cause of the death of the fishermen was the effect of radiation. </p><p>  These are far from all the anomalous places of Russia.  The mystical city of Arkaim in the Chelyabinsk region is distinguished by beauty and mystery.  Where two rivers, Karaganka and Utyaganka, converge into one, and this amazing historical heritage is located.  The city was discovered by archaeologists in 1987.  It has the form of rings enclosed in one another.  There are four entrances to the settlement - one on each side of the world.  The surviving buildings of Arkaim testify to an ancient civilization.  The city has amazing properties - it is able to heal from many diseases.  One who has been here once will certainly return again.  But not for everyone Arkaim is hospitable.  On some, he catches fear and horror.  Entrance is open only to the chosen ones. </p><h2>  Incredible places on Earth - for adventures! </h2><p>  We are surrounded by the unknown.  The most mysterious places of the planet are opened only to the elite.  People with great willpower who are ready for an exciting trip.  Our life is so short and fleeting that you will not even have time to look around as old age creeps up.  And well, closing his eyes, recall the mysterious places of the planet, in search of which he wandered around the world.  And who did not see the true beauty of our Earth - he almost did not live ... </p>
