Comparison with competitors</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among photography enthusiasts, the new <span>Canon 5D</span> Mark 3 is called full-frame.  For professionals, a full frame is a great joy.  So, you can use any optics without taking into account the crop factor.  In addition, this is a classic format of 35 millimeters, a higher level of photosensitivity due to large pixels.  The medium format is popular among professional photographers with a narrower specialization, but devices with full-frame capabilities are what many broad-profile specialists, as well as photographers, dream of.  Giving the market a good camera with a full format, the manufacturer automatically secured a lot of joyful fans.  The Canon 5D Mark 3 is a classic example. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon eos 5d mark iii review and comparison" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1000878.jpg" width="600"></div>  Full frame is becoming more and more popular every day, the first camera was released in 2005.  And today a new model has been added to the lineup.

    <p>  In theory, along with the recently released D800 from the leading manufacturer Nikon, the soap dish is positioned as a semi-professional full-frame SLR camera.  A professional niche is filled with other devices.  However, this is only a theory, but in fact, this model is used not only by amateurs, but also by true professionals in photo art.  Despite the enormous popularity of the full frame, the 5D line was considered an object of criticism.  Professionals wanted a little more than just the ability to get great shots.  For them, it was necessary that the device allows you to take pictures quickly and without errors.  And here the ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù of the Canon 5D Mark 3 turned out to be just such, as many users note. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  The matrix of the camera is made using CMOS technology.

With this device you can get high-quality images with a resolution of up to 5760x3840 pixels.  Bayonet - EF.  The manufacturer did not equip the device with the image stabilization function, but it is in optics.  The device has a new, more technological processor for processing.  The viewfinder in the camera is optical.  It is a translucent pentoprism.  He is fast enough.  There is a function for previewing the <span>depth of field, the</span> ability to correct images by diopters.  The screen in the Canon 5D Mark 3 is created using TFT technology, its diagonal is 3.2 inches.  It is equipped with anti-reflective coating and an excellent viewing angle of 170 degrees.  The camera has manual or automatic focusing with the ability to select points.  Shutter - electron-focal type.  Shutter speed is available in the range from 30-1 / 8000 s, and there is also an arbitrary, longer shutter speed. </p><p>  The camera is capable of shooting at up to 6 frames per second at maximum quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="review canon eos 5d mark iii test" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1000877.jpg" width="555"></div>  Features are limited only by the size of the memory card.  There are a lot of ways to take photos - this is single-frame shooting, continuous, silent, single-frame or silent continuous.  All images can be processed immediately on efficient algorithms.  The manufacturer provided a lot of options for setting <span>white balance.</span>  Pleased with the organization of shooting video.  So, you can shoot high-quality video in HD-resolution with various settings.  The device can recognize more than 21 scenes.  The case of the device is reliably protected from dust and water.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How much can I buy a Canon EOS 5D Mark 3 camera?  The price of new items on the Russian market is from 108,000 to 135,000 rubles.  For a model equipped with a 24-70 lens, you will have to pay from 151 thousand, for version 24-105 - from 140 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Camera design </h2><p>  Appearance in no way carries any load.  But at the same time it is very functional.  Of course, you can try to find beauty in the contours of the hull or, conversely, some ugliness, but this search is nothing more than taste.  The case is very large and at the same time most prepared for any needs of professionals.  Case color - black.  The chassis of the device is made of magnesium alloy and coated with plastic.  In places of contact with the photographer‚Äôs hands, the manufacturer equipped the case with a special relief coating of rubber.  The Canon 5D Mark 3 is practically no different from the previous model in the lineup in terms of design, but the differences in functionality are quite noticeable. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Those who know and remember the location of the main controls on the device of the second version will be glad to purchase this new product.  After all, now designers and ergonomics specialists have added something that was so lacking.  So, the toggle switch for turning off is now located closer to the selector of shooting modes.  The toggle switch, as well as the selector, has become noticeably more convenient. </p><p>  To make it possible to lock the control wheel, instead of the on / off switch, the manufacturer installed a special lever in its place.  Quite unusual trends in functionality touched a few more nuances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon 5d mark 3 photos" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1000883.jpg" width="555"></div>  So, on the power button is a button to call the quick menu.  They also added a separate multi-button, a button for evaluating ready-made pictures, a video recording button.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the front panel there is a bayonet, a button for releasing the lens, indicators.  As well as a remote control sensor.  At the back are the familiar buttons and screen.  By the way, the screen is now noticeably the largest. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  The location and number of interfaces have not changed much since the second model.  Left on the edge - high-speed USB, HDMI, video outputs, headphone jack, microphone jack.  On the right you can see the compartment for installing memory cards. </p><p>  In addition to the selector and the power button, in the upper part there is a shoe, shutter button, dial for adjustments, a mini-screen to control the main characteristics, as well as several multi-function buttons.  A compartment for batteries, as well as a thread for a tripod - these elements are traditionally located at the bottom. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  In the new Canon 5D Mark 3, the specifications and overall dimensions from the second version differ by only a few millimeters.  At the same time, the weight became higher - 910 grams for the new product and 810 grams for the previous model.  The lightweight camera has now become even heavier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon 5d mark 3 specifications" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1000882.jpg" width="600"></div>  Although this will not be able to affect the popularity and sales.  This is not a smartphone, where, for the sake of compactness, manufacturers go for the understatement of the technical characteristics of the lens.

    <p>  Despite the excess weight, the convenience with which the device lies in the hand, not a bit was harmed.  A sufficiently large rubberized protrusion made specifically for the hand, as well as buttons for the right hand make it convenient to work with the device.  However, it is worth increasing the strength of the hands and building neck muscles - some users joke. </p><p>  Build on top.  The case is perfectly protected and will not let its owner down even in the most difficult conditions. </p><h2>  Management, menu </h2><p>  About how the buttons are located, has already been written.  These changes are made due to the higher number of functions implemented in the device.  So, there was a need for faster navigation through the menu and a special emphasis on video functions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon 5d mark 3" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1000880.jpg" width="600"></div>  You can argue for a long time about which manufacturer of professional cameras provides more convenient control, but those who are used to devices of this line will like it.  The developers did not spoil the matrix, but fixed it a little.

    <p>  There are changes to the menu interface, but they are few.  In Canon 5D Mark 3, the firmware divides the menu into several horizontal sections.  They are colored.  So, red color is the basic settings of photos, blue is responsible for video playback.  Basic settings are highlighted in yellow.  And orange is the control of the buttons, the exposure compensation step.  Green color - user menu.  It provides quick access to basic functions.  A new group has also been added - these are autofocus settings.  The manufacturer highlighted them in purple.  Canon engineers made it possible to customize this feature very flexibly. </p><p>  The quick menus have undergone purely cosmetic changes.  For such a device with a rather complicated organization, it is simply impossible to create the simplest and most accessible main menu.  Those who are going to study the system will be a little lost at first.  But the organization of the menu is almost perfect.  All settings Canon 5D Mark 3 will do automatically.  Many aspiring photographers praised this technical solution. </p><p>  The mechanisms for working with photos and videos have improved.  Now sorting has become even easier.  Now you can inspect and compare frames on one screen, however, it is not enough for this. </p><h2>  Screen and viewfinder </h2><p>  As for the viewfinder, it is traditional here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to configure canon 5d mark 3" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1000881.jpg" width="600"></div>  It can be used with any optical systems companies without any restrictions.  Thanks to the use of a special translucent screen, you can get information about the main characteristics directly in the viewfinder.  The ability to take pictures on the screen also did not disappear.  The screen itself was enlarged and modernized.  Now brightness and color reproduction are even better and more natural.

    <p>  At first glance, the camera was adapted for video shooting.  Now it‚Äôs much more convenient to do this than before, say those who worked with older models. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  Canon 5D Mark 3 Body in terms of concept is not much different from the previous model.  However, the basic basic elements are completely new.  This is a new 22 megapixel sensor with an improved pixel layout, as well as a different noise reduction system.  The new processor has become seventeen times more powerful, which makes it possible to use the device much faster. </p><p>  The main role in increasing the speed of working with the camera gave the focus screen.  Not only the speed of guidance, but also the accuracy has grown.  You can focus on points or the entire area.  Now the device is perfect even for professional <span>reportage shooting.</span> </p><p>  No autofocus highlighting.  This is quite sad, because there is no flash in the device.  You have to work in the absence of lighting almost manually, and novice users who do not know how to configure the Canon 5D Mark 3 correctly will receive blurry pictures.  Those who are only trying their hand at photography note this flaw. </p><p>  The new shutter pleases with its noiselessness.  Silent operation helps a lot, especially for shooting various reports.  But at the same time you have to abandon the speed of response. </p><p>  Many photography enthusiasts will like the creative modes implemented here.  They are made as standard, but in detail.  In multiple exposure mode, you can use the captured photos, and pictures can be processed in four modes. </p><p>  The HDR mode works surprisingly well, but it will not be able to win the competition with manually glued frames.  There are also color profiles in the camera for a wide variety of subjects.  You can also change the lighting settings. </p><h2>  Canon 5D Mark 3 Video Overview </h2><p>  The camera, unfortunately, does not know how to shoot modern videos in the format of 60 frames per second.  But great videos come out with a standard frequency.  The developers proposed a progressive scan.  Now you can choose compression methods. </p><p>  When shooting, any settings are available to the photographer.  Work with sound - at the highest level, but there is no possibility of streaming.  There is no autofocus function.  To shoot great videos on this device, you have to learn a little. </p><h2>  Image Quality </h2><p>  How does the Canon 5D Mark 3 take photos?  With a standard and well-known full-time standard lens, photos are imperfect.  However, it is quite versatile and well suited for most situations.  Naturally, this camera should be used with a large set of optics. </p><p>  It is impossible to say something special about the available optics for the model - everyone already knows the number of available models, the quality is objective.  With the camera, you can use a removable mount from other manufacturers. </p><p>  The automatic mode for beginners in photography who prefer not to learn this art, but to invest a certain amount in professional equipment, in Canon 5D Mark 3 is implemented quite adequately.  The system automatically and fairly correctly selects the parameters, autofocus works fine, there is even the possibility of automatic shooting immediately in RAW. </p><p>  White balance in automatic mode is also significantly improved.  Naturally, he still can not determine the type of lighting without errors, but there are much fewer errors than in the previous model of the line.  Now you don‚Äôt need to use the white sheet so often and configure everything manually. </p><p>  The matrix allows for a high level of detail.  There are no complaints to the camera on this issue.  Photos are very clear with a deep level of study.  But this is true for RAW. </p><p>  A comparative review of the Canon EOS 5D Mark III and a comparison of this camera can be done with only one major competitor.  This is a Nikon D800.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã36 megapixels, but this is not an advantage.  These characteristics are perfect for large-format shooting. </p><p>  A full-format SLR camera is so highly regarded among understanding people for the ability to give quiet shots at high ISO levels.  Here Canon's product outperforms Nicon, as experienced photographers say. </p><p>  However, the Canon 5D Mark III 1.3.3 is a pretty aggressive squelch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon 5d mark 3 settings" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1000879.jpg" width="600"></div>  The latter may reduce detail.  Fortunately, it is disconnectable.  The photographer himself can choose what is important in a given situation.  The camera is very user friendly.

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device already has a traditional lithium-ion battery.  She is the same as in the previous model.  The capacity is enough for nine hundred shots without a difference in format.  This is a great result for an amateur.  And professional photographers will definitely purchase for themselves an additional battery pack.  As for the rest of the accessories, everything is fine with this.  There is everything for any occasion, including an additional flash, which is not in the basic configuration. </p><h2>  Opinions and final review of the Canon eos 5D Mark III </h2><p>  The test showed that although the changes are minor, but the work has improved significantly.  61 points for autofocus, metering for 63 zones, a powerful processor, the possibility of burst shooting at a speed of 6 frames.  New shutter, new matrix.  Improved features for video enthusiasts.  The camera has changed a lot, and it makes sense to switch to it, people who are fond of photography believe. </p><p>  This is a fairly evolutionary product that develops a model of universality.  So, it is more than enough for shooting reports, for story photos, for amateurs and professionals, for studios and shooting videos.  With this device for the photographer opens up great freedom for creativity. </p><p>  Naturally, the Japanese device has some disadvantages.  For example, only one firmware is currently available (Canon 5D Mark III 1.2.3).  Reviews also note that the camera is quite heavy (weighs almost one kilogram) and does not shoot video at 60 frames per second.  Plus the big disadvantage is the high price. </p><p>  However, all these shortcomings are not too significant.  Experts predict a good future for this camera.  After all, this is a universal and well-balanced model that compares favorably with all currently existing full-frame cameras.  She will cope with the main competitors perfectly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we found out what features the Japanese Kenon Mark 3 camera has.  As you can see, this is a very good purchase for those who are engaged in photographing at a professional level. </p>
