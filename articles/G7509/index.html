The right-wing forces, which included the nobility, officers and clergy, believed that it was time to end the ‚Äúrevolutionary anarchy‚Äù that had established in the country, therefore they welcomed the introduction of a military dictatorship and the elimination of the Soviets.  But the "left" - the Bolshevik party - took a firm course towards the overthrow of the Provisional Government and the final establishment of their power in the country. </p><p>  The general situation was constantly deteriorating.  The peasants did not wait for the promised land, and discontent was growing among the workers.  Ukraine and Finland moved towards full autonomy.  The soldiers and sailors were massively carried away by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa class revolution.  The country was threatened by hunger. </p><p>  Under these conditions, Russian society resembled a powder keg that could explode at any time.  <span>The interim government</span> realized that only a new strong government and military dictatorship could save the state from final collapse.  General Kornilov was elected to the role of dictator.  He enjoyed great respect among soldiers and officers, was a man of power, decisive and tough.  In danger, he showed absolute decency, devotion to his homeland and all the best qualities of his strong will. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Being appointed commander-in-chief instead of General Brusilov, he imposed a ban on rallies at the front, established execution for desertion, and significantly limited the rights and powers of soldiers' committees.  From the government, he demanded the militarization of railways and defense enterprises. </p><p>  On August 12, 1917, the head of the Provisional Government Kerensky convened a State Conference in which the landowners, representatives of the bourgeoisie, officers, top cossacks and clergy, and the generals took part.  At this meeting, they discussed the introduction of the <span>death penalty,</span> reprisals against peasants who arbitrarily seize the land of the landowners, the prohibition of workers from interfering in production, the prohibition of rallies and meetings. </p><p>  General Kornilov demanded the establishment of iron discipline, permission to impose the death penalty and the complete abolition of the Soviets.  He said somewhat veiledly that in order to fight against the revolution and the Bolsheviks he would surrender Riga to the German troops in order to thus open the way for them to Petrograd - the bulwark of revolutionary forces. </p><p>  Most of the participants in the meeting warmly supported the statement of the general.  Kornilov had complete confidence that the troops would support him if he began a coup.  On the eve of the Meeting, they publicly expressed their support to the General, the Union of St. George Knights, the Union of Cossack Troops and many other associations. </p><p>  And on August 21, German troops occupied Riga, about which Kornilov warned.  It seemed that the situation for the coup and the establishment of a dictatorship was the most favorable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Kornilov rebellion: events of August 27-31, 1917</strong> </p><p>  After the State Conference, General Kornilov returned to Headquarters and, guided by the decision of the Provisional Government and the consent of Kerensky, began to illegally send his troops to Petrograd.  He sent the 3rd cavalry corps and the ‚ÄúWild‚Äù (Native) division headed by <span>Lieutenant General Krymov</span> to the capital <span>.</span> </p><p>  At this time, Kerensky was playing his own game.  On August 27, he ordered Kornilov to resign as commander in chief, and after the general‚Äôs logical refusal to obey, he declared him a rebel.  Actually, Kerensky did not expect Kornilov to obey him.  In fact, it was a huge provocation, aimed at strengthening the power of Kerensky himself. </p><p>  So, Kerensky begins to conduct confusing negotiations with the Headquarters, in which Prince Lvov acts as an intermediary.  He is trying to defame Kornilov with all his might, but the Provisional Government nevertheless refuses to recognize him as a rebel.  In response, Kerensky dissolves the government and assumes emergency dictatorial powers.  He personally removes Kornilov from office, although this is an absolutely illegal act.  At the same time, he is trying to stop the advance of the "Wild Division" Kornilov on Petrograd. </p><p>  Kornilov, refusing to obey Kerensky, assumes power in its entirety and begins to issue appeals to the people and the army.  In particular, he promises to ‚Äúsave Great Russia‚Äù, achieve the convocation of a <span>Constituent Assembly,</span> accuses the Bolsheviks of conspiring with Germany, and calls on the people not to obey the government.  Kornilov's speeches were supported by many organizations and military associations.  But, since they were not previously involved in Kornilov‚Äôs struggle, only moral support could be provided. </p><p>  Kerensky at this time was frantically trying to stop Kornilov by any means.  He sends telegrams, ordering him to urgently leave for St. Petersburg, but Kornilov refuses to obey Kerensky.  In response, he openly sets out his demands: to exclude from the government those ministers who, according to Kornilov himself, are traitors to the motherland, and establish firm and strong power in the country. </p><p>  The wild division is advancing ever closer to Petrograd.  At the station of Antropshino, they arrange a firefight with the Petrograd garrison, occupying Luga before this and disarming the local garrison.  The interim government understands that it is not able to cope with Kornilov, and therefore seeks help from the Bolsheviks.  They send their agitators into the Kornilov‚Äôs troops, and the Petrograd workers officially distribute weapons, which subsequently will play one of the decisive roles in the victory of the Bolsheviks in the <span>October Revolution.</span> </p><p>  Kornilov managed to stop the troops on August 29.  The saboteurs dismantled the railway track, and the agitators convinced the soldiers to lay down their weapons and surrender.  Krymov left his army and went to Petrograd.  He felt cheated, so on the same day after negotiations with Kerensky mortally wounded himself with a shot in the chest. </p><p>  Kornilov refused to flee Stavka, although he was given such an opportunity.  On September 1, the general and the people closest to him were arrested.  The rebellion of General Kornilov was suppressed. </p><p>  <strong>Kornilov rebellion: consequences</strong> </p><p>  In the history of Russia, this event played a very important role.  Kerensky tried to consolidate his power, and instead played into the hands of the Bolsheviks.  They got an absolutely legal opportunity to arm themselves.  The intensive formation of new Red Guard detachments began.  The camp of the "right" essentially divided in itself, which means it has lost the ability to hold and strengthen its power. </p><p>  After these events, the Soviets began a new chapter in history, which led to the failure of the Provisional Government and the victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution. </p>
