These coins are made by real masters of jewelry from the highest quality silver.  They depict important historical episodes from the life of our state.  Sberbank issues both gold gift coins and silver.  In this article, we will touch on the descriptions of the latest products, as they are most accessible for purchase to ordinary people, based on the lower cost of silver in relation to gold or platinum. </p><h2>  Types of Silver Coins </h2><p>  These coins come in two varieties: investment and commemorative.  Each of them has its own parameters and characteristics. </p><p>  <em>1. Investment products</em> </p><p>  Such silver coins of Sberbank are specially created for investing savings with their subsequent profitable sale, if necessary.  The quality of the metal used in the manufacture of coins has the highest fineness, due to which the product is highly sensitive in contact with air or human hands.  So that the coins do not lose their color and do not fall in price, they should be stored in special transparent cases. </p><p>  <em>2. Anniversary and commemorative coins</em> </p><p>  Such items are minted in small series, they display various historical events or dates that are especially important for our people and the state.  Basically, such coins are in demand among collectors-numismatists, they are a good souvenir, perfectly suitable as a gift. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Coin "George the Victorious" </h2><p>  This <span>investment coin</span> is the most massive among its kind.  It was produced during 2009-2010.  From 2011 to 2014, its coinage was suspended.  But since 2015, this product began to be produced again, with a series of about half a million copies.  The products are made of <span>999 silver,</span> weighing a little more than 31 grams, with a face value of three rubles. </p><p>  <span>The coin "George the Victorious"</span> is sold in a special transparent plastic package installed in a cardboard box, which allows you to store a valuable item in proper conditions. </p><p>  The first such coins were minted in gold in 2006, then silver ones appeared.  The first option is also the most massive in production - more than 27 thousand kilograms of high-grade gold was spent on their manufacture. </p><p>  The cost of the silver version of this coin is about 2 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  The cost of silver coins of Sberbank </h2><p>  The cost of the products described is different and varies from 2 to 60 thousand rubles apiece.  The type and purpose of a coin primarily affects the price of a coin.  So, the cost of commemorative products is affected by their circulation and the quality of coinage;  the price of investment coins is equal to the value of the metal from which they are made. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, a <span>silver coin of</span> Sberbank: its price and prestige depend on the mass of the specimen, the quality of the sample and the place of sale.  In the capital, such coins are fairly cheaper than in regional offices, because there are no costs for the delivery of products, which are necessarily reflected in the cost of the goods. </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  Sberbank silver coins are a very reliable investment of their savings.  They will always be near their owner, no one can give them a loan to another person, as many banks do with their customers' deposits.  Therefore, savings do not depend on the economic component of banking.  Monetary inflation depreciates the state currency several times faster than it does with precious metals.  Quite the contrary: the prices of gold, silver and platinum often exceed the psychologically permissible level. </p><p>  It should also be borne in mind that this is not a simple investment of their accumulated money in precious metals, but investment in a highly artistic work.  How much is a silver or gold royal ruble a hundred years old now?  According to the most conservative estimates, the price of coins of tsarist times is 3-4 times higher than the cost of the metal itself.  How much can I sell Soviet commemorative rubles in denominations of 1 and 3 rubles now?  At least a few tens, or even hundreds of times more than their face value.  That is why more and more people are trying to trust their savings not to banking organizations that can go bankrupt at any time, and then look for winds in the field, but to silver and other coins of the banks of the countries where they live.  Banks, countries, nations can disappear and change, but silver and other expensive metals will always be appreciated, and nothing will happen to them. </p>
