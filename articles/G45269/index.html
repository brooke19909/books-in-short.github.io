Having burst into the digital market with their models, this manufacturer managed to set his own tone of attitude towards mobile gadgets.  So version 5 seamlessly merged into this line.  In this review, the Huawei Honor 5C phone with specifications will be examined in detail. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  With its average cost of 11,000 rubles, the device has quite attractive characteristics.  The design is as simple as possible, apparently for the sake of technical stuffing.  The entire front part is covered with glass.  In the upper area there is a hole for the speaker.  Next to it, the camera and proximity and light sensors are already canonically located.  The edges of the perimeter of the smartphone are rounded under a small radius.  The device has two microphones.  The main one is located below, the additional one is above.  There is also a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack. </p>

    <p>  There are two separate slots for <span>SIM cards</span> .  However, if you need to expand the memory due to the SD card, you will have to replace one of the slots.  Convenient or not, reviews will show. </p><p>  The back of the smartphone is a metal panel, pleasant to the touch.  It houses the main camera and flash.  Interestingly, the version of the gadget for the Chinese market is equipped with a fingerprint scanner located on the rear panel.  For Europe, for some reason, they decided to remove this characteristic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The volume and power buttons are located on the right side of the smartphone.  In fact, it has already become a classic for mobile gadgets. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Specifications <span>Huawei Honor 5C</span> pretty "nice."  The main load is borne by the eight-core Kirin 650 processor. Interestingly, 4 of them operate at 2 GHz with Cortex-A72, and 4 at 1.7 GHz with Cortex-A53.  For graphics processing, the ARM Mali-T830 MP2 at a frequency of 600 MHz is used.  The technological process is 16-nanometer.  This approach has reduced the cost of electricity consumption.  And due to the fact that a larger number of transistors can be placed on a chip with a smaller area, the cost of creating a product decreases with an increase in productivity in general.  These characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C, of ‚Äã‚Äãcourse, are not top-notch, but rather average.  The Antutu test shows 53,200, which is pretty good. </p>

    <p>  RAM in the phone is 2 GB.  This is a worthy indicator for this class of smartphones.  The internal memory is 16. And, as usual, about 10 are available to the user. With the growth in the volume of applications and games, this is not such a high indicator.  And given the fact that when using two SIM cards, the slot for the flash card will be busy, and it is impossible to expand the total amount of memory, you will have to save system resources. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Screen in TFT-IPS smartphone.  Its size is 5.2 inches with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels.  The final pixel density is 424 dpi.  Viewing angles are excellent, color reproduction is also on top.  The light sensor will help you adjust the brightness for any external lighting.  The touch screen is capable of recognizing up to 10 simultaneous touches. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  The characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C in terms of interfaces are also interesting.  All known 4G frequencies in the phone are supported.  A small limitation may be the fact that only one SIM card in a given unit of time can use LTE.  The second <span>SIM card</span> will have to be content with the GSM standard. </p><p>  As for wireless interfaces, here is "full stuffing."  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 and NFC.  With sufficient configuration, the latter can be used for contactless payment using Android Pay. </p>

    <p>  Navigation can work in all currently known systems - GLONASS, GPS and Baidu.  On the "hot" satellites are in 10-15 seconds.  In cold mode, this will take almost twice as much time. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery has a capacity of 3000 mAh.  Given the characteristics of the phone Huawei Honor 5C, with active work, its charge is unlikely to be enough even for a day.  And ‚Äúserious‚Äù games can even land the device in 3-4 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The operating system is Android 6.0.  And above it there is a special add-on to the EMUI 4.1 interface.  It includes convenient innovations when arranging icons on the home screen.  One of the main features is the combination of icons in a shared folder.  The lock screen background is a gallery of images that you can subscribe to.  As a result, the phone will each time greet the user with a beautiful new picture.  It is also possible to change the entire color scheme as a whole.  One of the interesting ‚Äútricks‚Äù of EMUI is that when shaking a smartphone, the icons on the desktop are arranged.  In general, this add-in has many different parameters and configurations.  You can configure almost everything. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  There are quite a few pixels in the cameras.  The main one has 13 MP, the front one - 8. There is a special application for control.  It contains a bunch of different functions and settings.  You can take a panorama, shutter speed, set a variety of color balances. </p>

    <p>  When using the default settings and in clear weather, the quality of the pictures is excellent.  The room imposes its limitations, and the noise is visible much more clearly.  For shooting at dusk and at night you have to calibrate the camera settings manually. </p><h2>  Features for firmware </h2><p>  The smartphone lends itself perfectly to firmware.  True, for this you will have to tinker a bit, because the bootloader is locked out of the box and you need to unlock it first.  You will also need root rights, which is also solvable. </p><p>  On reputable sites on the network there are a large number of both ‚Äúcustom‚Äù and official firmware.  So for those who like to reflash and in various ways to upgrade their device, quite attractive prospects open up. </p><p>  The device has in its bowels the NFC module.  However, without root rights and an unlocked bootloader, paying with Android Pay will not work.  There are many instructions on the network on how to get a payment tool installed on your phone. </p><h2>  Overview of the main competitors </h2><p>  There are a lot of similar phones with the characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C.  Some are better in some ways, worse in some ways.  A list of the most suitable devices will be presented below. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A3 2016 </h2><p>  The Samsung representative has a Super AMOLED screen, a slightly smaller diagonal, namely 4.7 inches.  The Android version is older, relative to the Honor 5C.  The processor in this model is proprietary - Samsung Exynos 7578 with 4 cores of 1.5 GHz each.  The graphics are presented by the classic Mali-T720.  RAM in Samsung is 0.5 GB less, the amount of internal ROM is the same.  The set of wireless interfaces is exactly the same.  At the same time, the cost of the device is slightly higher and amounts to about 16,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Meizu M3s Mini </h2><p>  The Chinese model carries MediaTek MT6750.  It also has 8 cores, separated, in fact, by the same principle - 4 at 1.5 and 4 at 1 GHz.  The graphics are a bit different - the Mali-T860 MP2. </p>

    <p>  Size is a little smaller - 5 inches.  The screen resolution is an order of magnitude lower - 1280 by 720. The competitor‚Äôs ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version is 5.1.  There are two configurations of the RAM - with 2 and 3 "gigs", as well as ROMs with 16 and 32. The wireless interfaces are the same.  The cost of this unit is 500-1000 rubles more than the hero of the article. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 3 </h2><p>  This representative of the Chinese brand is running Android 5.1.  The screen has a density of 294 pixels per inch.  And this is with a resolution of 1280 by 720 and a size of 5 inches. </p><p>  The eight-core Snapdragon 616 is responsible for the computational processes. And for the graphic component - the Adreno 405 video accelerator. The sizes of RAM and built-in are similar.  The same applies to all wireless interfaces - they are identical to Huawei Honor 5C.  The main distinguishing feature of this phone is a capacious battery - 4100 mAh. </p><h2>  ZTE Blade V7 Lite </h2><p>  Another smartphone similar to the characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C LTE.  True, its cost is a couple of thousand less.  At the same time, the version of Android is the same - 6.0.  The screen has a lower resolution - 1280 by 720. Cameras have a similar number of pixels.  The memory that is built-in, which is operational, is the same. </p>

    <p>  Significant differences are observed in the used processors.  Here is the MediaTek MT6735P with 4 cores of 1 GHz.  The graphics adapter to the class below is the Mali-T720.  Battery less than 500 mAh. </p><h2>  Alcatel IDOL 4 6055K </h2><p>  Similar technical characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C are in this model.  The price, operating system, resolution and screen size are the same.  The processor is slightly more powerful.  Here is the Snapdragon 617 with 8 cores.  The video accelerator is Adreno 405. The amount of RAM is also larger - 3 GB.  Battery capacity is 2600 mAh. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The characteristics of the smartphone Huawei Honor 5C have collected a large number of positive comments. </p><p>  As for the screen, users note excellent brightness and picture quality.  He was pleased with his quick adaptation to the external environment using a light sensor. </p><p>  One of the users left a detailed review about the characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C.  In it, he expressed admiration for this unit.  Specifically, he liked the speed and consistently fast operation of applications and the device as a whole.  Running games is carried out with a bang.  The charge lasts a long time.  The display turned out to be very high quality and colorful.  The case several times saved the phone from falls.  Updating to Android 7.0 passed without problems.  Well, of course, the price could not but please.  Navigation picks up satellites very quickly.  The same goes for positioning. </p>

    <p>  Another of the noted characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C NEM L51 was the fast Internet.  Sites open instantly, downloading applications also did not disappoint. </p><p>  Branded EMUI looks comfortable, albeit unusual.  At first, you will have to get to some settings through the ‚Äújungle‚Äù of system menus and icons.  But then it will seem more familiar than the standard application of the Android operating system. </p><p>  The use of any unlimited tariff will be relevant for this smartphone.  Watching and downloading videos in HD format for this unit is a simple task. </p><p>  The function of protecting the eyes from the effects of special frequencies of light is also interesting.  When it is turned on, the load on the visual organs decreases, and reading something from the screen becomes more convenient and safer. </p><p>  An undoubted plus is the fact that the smartphone is able to switch from productive cores to more economical ones.  This saves the battery for less "heavy" processes.  And it will optimize performance for demanding applications. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not without negative comments.  Someone seemed to have few characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C.  16 GB, declared by the manufacturer, are in reality 10. Automatic switching from 3G to 4G does not always happen.  I have to install in forced mode.  However, this approach becomes inconvenient if the user moves to an area where the latest generation communication standard is not supported. </p><p>  One user noted a number of characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C Pro in a negative context.  This applies to cheap external materials and appearance in general.  Also sometimes noted "dull" light sensor.  The same problems are often observed with the proximity sensor. </p><p>  Screen coverage does not always look perfect after heavy use.  As a result, fingerprints remain on the surface. </p><p>  The implementation of a joint slot, in which you have to use either an SD card or a SIM card, causes some inconvenience.  For example, if a certain application is installed on a USB flash drive, and you need to urgently use a second <span>SIM card</span> , the program will not be able to work. </p><p>  In low light, a camera with 13 megapixels takes pictures with rather poor detail. </p><p>  With very active use of the device, the battery fails very much.  Users note that a larger device could be installed in such an apparatus. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In general, a review of the characteristics of the Huawei Honor 5C and reviews about it showed that the phone has more positive and convenient parameters than negative ones.  Good performance, user-friendly interface, sophisticated, but still high-quality camera.  The new version of the Android operating system with the ability to upgrade to version 7.  For the price that the manufacturer offers, the phone is excellent. </p><p>  By the way, the Honor series continues its victorious procession.  Each subsequent device after 5 is more and more perfect and technologically advanced.  To date, the release of Honor 9 with 4 cameras, a powerful processor, 4 or 6 gigabytes of RAM has already been announced. </p>
