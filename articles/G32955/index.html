    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main question that worries all vacationers: "How far is the Memories Splash 5 * complex from the beach?"  The hotel's beach is within walking distance, you should not worry about this.  In addition, the coast can be reached by tram, which runs through the territory.  If you wish, you can walk along the street with ducks and peacocks. </p><p>  The beach itself is a wide strip of truly chic sand.  The coast is wide and unlimited, so you can walk in any direction.  There are a lot of sun loungers on the shore, so there are never any problems with places.  Well, there‚Äôs no need to talk about the beauty and purity of the ocean.  All this you just need to see with your own eyes. </p><p>  Of course, sometimes storms occur here, although most of the time the weather in the Dominican Republic is simply amazing.  So, after agitation, algae appear in the water.  But this, according to tourists, does not interfere at all, since you can always walk a little to the side where there is no vegetation.  By the way, all the beaches in the Dominican Republic are very clean, even those that do not belong to anyone.  It can be seen that they are being cleaned. </p><h2>  Memories Splash 5 *: hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel has a fairly developed infrastructure.  On its territory there are five restaurants: main, family, Mexican, Italian.  In addition, there are eleven more bars, among which are an ice cream parlor, a sports bar, and three pool bars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="memories splash 5 babysitting service" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1441078.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also on the territory there is a conference room for 216 people, a disco, an amphitheater, a laundry (for a fee), a souvenir shop, a currency exchange office, an ATM, a beauty salon and three fresh water pools.  The hotel has everything you need that guests may need.  Even small children can be taken with them in Memories Splash 5 *.  The babysitting service, as well as the doctor, is provided for a fee. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  Memories Splash Punta Cana 5 * has its own water park, which is its pride.  In fact, this is the main attraction of the complex.  The fact is that there are not many water parks in the Dominican Republic.  In total there are three hotels with water slides.  It is in Memories that they are the most exciting and interesting.  On water rides, children are launched in growth.  On the main slides can get children above 120 centimeters.  And those who are lower can only try attractions for kids.  Throughout the water park there is staff who oversees the order.  The task of workers is to prevent collisions on a roller coaster.  In general, everything is organized at the proper level.  Children older than seven or eight years old may well visit the water park itself.  This is a favorite place for vacationers who express extraordinary enthusiasm for this place. </p><h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  The hotel has its own spa complex.  Only there is one but.  The cost of his services is not included in the price of the tour.  Therefore, if you want to visit the sauna, pool and procedures, you will have to pay for everything.  The spa is very beautiful and worthy.  A trip to the sauna with the pool will cost about forty dollars. </p><h2>  Kids club </h2><p>  The hotel has a kids club, which operates on the same system as similar institutions in Turkey.  Here you can leave your kids with prior registration.  True, the club does not have Russian-speaking teachers.  However, children are not a hindrance.  You can even leave the child for the whole day if you decide to go on an excursion, but do not want to tire your baby.  Animators will surely feed the ward.  Tourists are very pleased with the children's animation. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Fresh juices are available at the hotel.  Every morning there is caviar and champagne.  They serve a lot of delicious fruits.  For breakfast, you can try porridge, cheese and meat slices, scrambled eggs, toasts.  The chef cooks incredibly tasty meat.  In general, there are a lot of meat dishes: beef, pork, chicken in a variety of variations.  According to vacationers, food is organized at the proper level. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The staff at Memories Splash 5 * (Punta Cana) uses only Spanish and English.  Therefore, if you do not own one of them, then you will have to explain yourself on the fingers.  This is due to the fact that tourists from Russia can be met here extremely rarely.  But often in the Dominican Republic, Russian-speaking immigrants rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="memories splash 5 hotel infrastructure" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1441081.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  I would like to note that the hotel staff is very friendly.  If tourists come ahead of time, then the issue is solved very simply.  Guests are sent to their room, if it is ready, or temporarily lodged in other apartments so that people can relax from the road.  Cleaning is done every day.  The rooms are always clean and very neat.  Towels are issued not only for adults, but also for each child.  It is very comfortable.  In restaurants, waiters serve rather promptly.  You never have to wait long.  According to tourists, the staff is friendly and helpful. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  For active tourists, the hotel has a tennis court, gym, table tennis.  Vacationers can play mini-golf, basketball, volleyball, do aerobics, diving, play board games. </p><p>  In the daytime, guests of the complex expect sports and entertainment events from animators, and in the evening - music, dance programs. </p><p>  A huge advantage of the hotel is the availability of high-quality Wi-Fi throughout the large territory. </p><h2>  Climate of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  Dominican Republic is a paradise country for relaxation.  The reason for this is its climate, subtropical and humid.  The heat is very easily tolerated, as there are soft trade winds and breezes. </p><p>  The rainy season lasts from May to September.  At this time there are frequent but short showers.  Rains in December and November are possible.  For the rest of the year, the weather in the Dominican Republic is very warm and dry.  The best time to relax is the period from December to April.  But if your vacation falls at a completely different time, do not despair.  Showers in no way interfere with your vacation.  The fact is that the rains here, although heavy, but short-term, literally in half an hour no trace of water can be seen. </p><p>  If you want to go out during a rainstorm, the service will kindly offer you a huge umbrella.  In such periods, an ocean storm can be observed.  This is something awesome! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="memories splash 5 premium numbers" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1441080.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Dominican Republic is an amazing place.  On a relatively small territory of the state there are snow-white spacious beaches, the ocean, the sea, and mountain peaks, arid deserts, moist forests.  The temperature from +26 to +30 degrees is kept here all year round.  At any time, tourists are waited by the warm ocean and the hot sun. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Many newlyweds like the Dominican Republic.

    <p>  Costa del Barn is a very popular tourist area.  It is also called the "Amber Coast."

    <p>  In general, to get acquainted with tourists with the sights of the Dominican Republic, you definitely need to start from the capital, Santo Domingo.  In this wonderful city you can look into the Cathedral, visit the Museum of Tobacco, stroll through the picturesque streets. </p><p>  But, undoubtedly, the most important attraction of the Dominican Republic is its endless sandy beaches.  The most beautiful and most popular places are in the province of Puerto Plata, located in the north of the country. </p><p>  We gave an example of only a few Dominican attractions that are worth seeing.  In fact, they are much larger and, perhaps, one vacation is not enough to see them. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Those tourists who are planning to visit the Dominican Republic in the near future can recommend the Memories Splash Hotel.  Its excellent location, good service, beautiful and comfortable rooms are the key to a wonderful holiday.  A long sandy white beach and a turquoise ocean is the dream of any vacationer. </p>
