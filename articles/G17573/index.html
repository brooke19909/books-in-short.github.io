  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Desert Storm</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1991, all the persistent attempts by the <span>international community to</span> persuade the Hussein regime to withdraw the army from Kuwait ended to no avail.  As a result, the anti-Iraq coalition, whose multinational forces were concentrated in the <span>Persian Gulf region,</span> launched military operations in accordance with the mandate of the Security <span>Council of the United Nations.</span>  The operation became conventionally called "Desert Storm." </p><p>  Multinational forces were represented indirectly or directly by 34 countries led by the United States.  In terms of the quality of ammunition and weapons and combat capabilities, the advantage was on the side of America and its allies. </p><p>  According to foreign media reports, the overall plan, which contained Operation Desert Storm, called for the conduct of hostilities in several stages. </p><p>  The first stage involved an attack on key troops and targets, both in Iraq and Kuwait.  At the same time, it was supposed to use aviation, naval and marine forces, as well as Tomahok cruise missiles.  The primary targets targeted by Desert Storm were air defense systems, combat aircraft, launch missile positions (ground-to-ground), troop concentration zones, and the main military and state command and control posts. </p><p>  The second phase of hostilities included the disabling of the most important elements <span>of the Iraqi military-industrial</span> complex, as well as the infrastructure of Iraq.  Using Tomahok cruise missiles and a series of systematic air strikes, it was also planned to destroy the country's mechanized and tank formations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the third stage, ‚ÄúDesert Storm‚Äù was supposed to go on the ground offensive movements with the joint efforts of the marine corps and ground forces, with the support of carrier-based, tactical and strategic aircraft, together with special forces, airmobile and airborne assault forces. </p><p>  At the fourth stage, military operations consisted of offensives by the Marine Corps and the Ground Forces completing the rout of the Iraqi forces in Kuwait in order to restore its territorial and state integrity. </p><p>  It was supposed to carry out the operation within two to three weeks.  As a result, the Iraqi armed forces were to be dealt irreparable damage in technology and manpower.  In addition, it was assumed that the ‚ÄúDesert Storm‚Äù would significantly undermine military-economic opportunities, which, in turn, would lead to the absolute surrender of the Hussein regime. </p><p>  However, in practice, hostilities did not take place in full accordance with what was planned by the plan.  This, in turn, intensified the conflict.  The Desert Storm, which began unexpectedly in 1991, on January 17 at night, allowed to disorganize the Iraqi military command and control system and partially eliminate Iraq‚Äôs air defense facilities. </p><p>  However, from the second day of hostilities, the army of the multinational forces was resisted by the air force and ground enemy air defense systems.  The Iraqi government carried out operational disguise using pre-prepared false radio networks and an object, firing and launching positions, and alternate aerodromes. </p><p>  After some hesitation, the anti-Iraq coalition (the United States and its allies) chose the option of continuing the air campaign, delivering systematic missile and bomb attacks.  Along with this, preparations were made for units of the marine corps and <span>ground forces</span> for the start of a large-scale operation. </p><p>  It should be noted that the continuation of air strikes has changed the nature and purpose of the war, as it was already aimed at eliminating the Iraqi economy.  Going beyond the UN Security Council resolution, which demanded "the liberation of Kuwait," military operations were carried out in the interests of overthrowing the ruling regime by inflicting irreparable damage on the <span>military-economic potential</span> . </p><p>  Thus, the continuation of the war increased the number of problems unpredictable by the nature of the consequences. </p>
