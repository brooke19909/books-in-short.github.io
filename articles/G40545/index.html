    <h2>  What else do guests say? </h2><p>  If you look at the reviews left about your stay at Lindos Princess Beach Hotel, you can see that this hotel is really as good as it is presented in the standard descriptions.  But not for everyone.  This hotel is definitely not suitable for people who prefer a quiet holiday.  Yes, the place where the hotel is located is calm.  But the hotel itself is quite noisy.  This is because the vast majority of tourists go here with their children.  Anyway, in the summer.  In winter there are fewer tourists, which, in principle, is logical.  Although the climate allows you to relax here even in January. </p><p>  By the way, guests are advised to rent a car and drive around the island on their own.  In Rhodes there are such picturesque places where excursions are not conducted.  But you can see for yourself much more interesting sights and outlandish landscapes. </p><p>  However, this is a good hotel complex for those people who want to have fun from the heart in pleasant conditions, buy plenty at sea and not deny anything in terms of food.  If someone dreams of such a vacation, then it is worth going here on your vacation.  No one will feel sorry.  Numerous reviews confirm this. </p>
