  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Non-operating income and their composition</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the study of economic activity, in addition to analyzing the state of <span>financial results,</span> results of execution and income from work, production of commodity products, studying the state of fixed assets and other assets, the analysis of the profit and loss that were received by the enterprise from non-operating operations is of great importance.  The composition of these costs includes those that are included in the cost of all of the above, and more specifically: </p><p>  - non-operating income derived from equity or shareholding in other companies and corporations, including in the form of dividends on securities belonging to this company.  These revenues, as a rule, are formed in cases of profit in the form of its part from the profits of other enterprises.  A dividend is a portion of the profit calculated on one ordinary or <span>preferred share.</span>  A bond is a <span>security whose</span> fact of existence confirms the obligation to reimburse the <span>face value of an</span> asset to its owner. </p><p>  - income that the company or organization can receive from the rental property, but only if this type of activity is not the main activity for this business entity.  Thus, non-operating income includes rent, as its value may be included in the value of the commissioned facilities when they are evaluated. </p><p>  - fines and other sanctions that have been paid and are recognized by the debtor company and which are paid for violation of the terms of business.  Forfeit is the amount determined by law that is payable by the debtor in case of violation of the contracts or their improper performance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - profit, which was established in the reporting year, but received in previous years.  It reflects the amounts received in the accounts of the enterprise for previously produced and sold goods.  In this case, accounting for non-operating income must be corrected taking into account the income received. </p><p>  - differences that were formed when enterprises or organizations conducted operations with foreign currency.  The resulting <span>exchange differences</span> during translations in connection with a change in the exchange rate, in this case will be allocated to the balance of future periods. </p><p>  - profit or loss incurred by the enterprise or organization when buying / selling foreign currency. </p><p>  - arrears of debts that were written off as uncollectible by the organization in the manner prescribed by law; </p><p>  - property surpluses that were established during the inventory and which are paid in cash to the accounts of the enterprise or organization; </p><p>  - expired due to prescription payables as well as deposits. </p><p>  - other non-operating income and expenses that are not directly related to production activities.  These include the amounts received by the bank for the use of the invested funds of the enterprise or organization, as well as other values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are attributable to one owner. </p><p>  - expenses incurred in connection with the rental of property: <span>depreciation,</span> expenses for their restoration and repair. </p><p>  - costs from downtime for external reasons. </p><p>  - Losses from revaluation of the stockpiled enterprise or organization, production stock and manufactured goods. </p><p>  - losses incurred from operations with containers. </p><p>  - legal costs. </p><p>  - the amount of debts and obligations recognized as doubtful and subject to reservation in the prescribed manner. </p><p>  - losses from writing off debts recognized in the established procedure as unrealistic. </p><p>  - <span>operating income</span> and expenses for past years.  It is important here that the origin of all these revenues and expenses is documented. </p><p>  - uncompensated losses arising from the impact of natural disasters or the costs associated with the elimination of their consequences. </p><p>  - costs of orders that were canceled or canceled, and in addition, costs of unproductive production. </p><p>  - losses from damage to property, its natural loss, exceeding the established norms. </p><p>  - taxes that are paid in accordance with applicable law. </p><p>  The exhaustive composition of non-operating income is given in Art.  250 Tax Code of the Russian Federation. </p>
