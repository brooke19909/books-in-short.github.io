In the article, we will learn how <span>to remove scratches from the phone screen.</span>  They arise as a result of friction of the screen on any ribbed surface. </p><h2>  What kind of scratches and where do they come from? </h2><p>  As noted, their occurrence is due to frequent contact with various surfaces.  Both in the pocket of the trousers and in the bag, with each movement, particles of materials interact with the screen of the smartphone. </p><p>  Especially detrimental to lying down with the screen.  For example, you come home and put the phone on a shelf or table, without thinking about its position in space.  If this is done so often, then after a few weeks you will notice small scratches that are clearly visible in sunlight. </p><h2>  Protective properties of covers </h2><p>  There is a deep misconception that the cover saves from chips on the screen and small cracks.  This is true only if it comes to the back of the phone, then it really saves from scratches. </p><p>  But if you bought a cover that completely covers the entire screen and cover, then safely throw it away.  It will not protect your device from scratches, but on the contrary, will contribute to their greater appearance.  And then you‚Äôll have to find out how to remove scratches on the glass of the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cover book" class="if uuid-2370462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2370462.jpg"></div><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that this does not apply to book covers.  Thanks to their design, they close the smartphone cover and screen.  At the same time, opening the cover, its part does not touch the screen and does not rub it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Scratch Prevention </h2><p>  Perhaps the easiest way is to order a <span>protective glass.</span>  On popular online sites, their selection is wide and you can find glass for your phone model.  The price for them varies from $ 0.50 to $ 3 (from 28 to 170 rubles), and elite models cost more than $ 10 (560 rubles). </p><p>  It‚Äôs easy to install them, and the child can handle this, though very neat.  The sellers put two wipes (ordinary and alcoholic) and sometimes a rag complete with a protective glass. </p><ol><li>  To get rid of grease stains, the screen is wiped with an alcoholized napkin. </li><li>  The usual napkin collects the remaining alcohol, it also cleans the screen additionally. </li><li>  The protective glass is extremely quickly unpacked and laid flat on the screen. </li></ol><p>  Do not push on the surface, the glass will stick on itself.  If white air bubbles appear under it, then you have poorly wiped the screen.  Carefully remove the glass and wipe the screen again, then return it to its place.  The procedure is repeated until all white spots disappear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="price.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Protective glass" class="if uuid-2369574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2369574.jpg"></div><p>  When you buy cheap glass, the color rendering will decrease and visually the screen will become more faded.  And forget about the oleophobic coating, sellers indicate it only to attract customers.  Glass will collect all your prints. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And be careful with your phone, not only at the time of purchase and a few more days.  Never put it face down, do not buy covers from which the phone must be removed.  Then you will not need to know how to remove scratches from the phone. </p><p>  But if they appeared, do not rush to the service center to replace the screen, read the article to the end, and you will permanently get rid of this problem. </p><h2>  The first way.  Car scratch remover </h2><p>  Not only cars using modern chemistry to get rid of chips and cracks in the body.  Car creams, varnishes, pencils are great for smartphones. </p><p>  You will not be able to remove all scratches.  For example, from the deep damage that is most noticeable in the light of day, no way will help you.  Only a replacement for the smartphone screen itself. </p><p>  So let's find out how to remove scratches from your phone using automotive tools.  To do this, you need to go to the car shop associated with the sale of various utilities for the car, find a tool for removing scratches there and purchase it for yourself.  If the instructions do not contain information on how to proceed, then here is a description for you: </p><ol><li>  Apply a little of the active ingredient to a clean cloth. </li><li>  Wipe the screen of the smartphone in a circular motion. </li></ol><p>  Do not be "fooled" by advertising on the Internet and never buy "expensive" and "good" funds.  Usually, they are sold on one-day sites where you can‚Äôt find out the company‚Äôs contacts and its name, as well as leave a review. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.totalcardiagnostics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anti-scratch pencil" class="if uuid-2369583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2369583.jpg"></div><h2>  The second way.  Toothpaste </h2><p>  It perfectly saves the smartphone from minor scratches and gives the screen a freshness.  For those who did not know, it is generally very versatile.  It not only gives the oral cavity a pleasant smell, but also perfectly cleans dirt. </p><p>  The paste removes scratches from the phone, but only if they are shallow.  Only regular toothpaste is suitable, none with microparticles or gel.  They will disturb your screen more than they will help. </p><p>  And so, the procedure is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Squeeze a little paste onto a dry swab or soft cloth. </li><li>  Wipe in a circular motion where your scratch is.  The rest of the screen is not recommended. </li><li>  Wipe any stains left from the paste with a pre-moistened cloth and rinse with a small amount of water. </li></ol><p>  This is the answer to the question, "how to remove scratches from the phone cover." </p><div class="photo" data-original="incolors.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toothpaste" class="if uuid-2369585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2369585.jpg"></div><h2>  The third way.  Grinding </h2><p>  To be honest, this method is not recommended for "crooked" comrades.  If sandpaper or the machine is not handled properly, you can seriously ruin your phone.  How to remove scratches from a gadget using this method is briefly described below. </p><p>  The secret is to use a fine-grained canvas and gently grind the smartphone screen.  Some craftsmen recommend mixing baby powder with water and wiping the resulting suspension with your phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="canacopegdl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sandpaper" class="if uuid-2369600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2369600.jpg"></div><h2>  The fourth way.  Soda </h2><p>  Soda is very versatile and is used not only to advertise weight loss from Malysheva, but also helps to learn how to remove scratches from the phone‚Äôs camera and screen. </p><p>  There is no need to do many actions here, you will need baking soda and water.  The method of use is as follows: </p><ol><li>  In a small container, mix soda with water in a ratio of two to one. </li><li>  Stir until a thick, paste-like mixture is formed. </li><li>  Apply a small layer of paste to a clean cloth. </li><li>  And with a cloth, rub soda into the phone screen, the main thing is not to overdo it. </li><li>  Wash off any remaining soda after all. </li></ol><p>  As you know, soda neutralizes acids, and so that your phone does not "cover" tightly close all openings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blackhairinformation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baking soda" class="if uuid-2369603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70625/2369603.jpg"></div><h2>  The fifth way.  Vegetable oil </h2><p>  An alternative method that does not remove scratches, but gives the phone a more presentable look and makes it more ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù.  One of the cheapest ways is very useful for those who want to sell their smartphone at a higher price and indicate "8/10" in the status bar. </p><p>  To do this, follow the procedure below: </p><ol><li>  Wipe off the dust on the phone screen. </li><li>  Apply one or two drops of oil to a dry cloth. </li><li>  Wipe the screen in circular motions until the oily stains disappear. </li><li>  Wet swab pass on the surface of the smartphone. </li></ol><p>  So we learned how to remove scratches from the phone in five ways. </p>
