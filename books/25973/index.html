        <p>Self help books is Brian Johnson‚Äôs creation.</p>
        <p>Brian has been running best business books 2020 and it‚Äôs refreshing to see a human being speak as he delivers some great what to read.</p>
        <p>I sometimes see his advertising on Facebook and I can tell you that he is the only guy I am actually happy to see among the ever annoying <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tai-lopez-scam/">Tai Lopez</a>, Sam Ovens, and all other snake oil salesmen :).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contageously positive guy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is the only guy who makes me happy when he shows up on my feed as a paid advertiser.
            <br> Don‚Äôt ask me how he pulls that off, but he does :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-quality self-development synonym</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The blackboard style feels like a free online university</strong></li>
            <li><strong>‚Äúmust read books of all time‚Äù by topic: The best summary of books free</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian and best books about businessmen are the only ones on this list to provide ‚Äúself-development tips‚Äù by topic.
            <br> Such as, taking tens of books on a given topic and summarize <em>all</em> their content into one (VS best self help books 2020 for each different books).
            <br> That way, you can get an overview of the whole self development books in one hour, saving tons of money and time.
            <br> You can check my 100 best books ever on the <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/store/">store page</a>.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not so free anymore</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Business books pdf on YouTube are still available.
            <br> But success books seems to be mostly locked down now, so those 100 best books guardian are not free anymore.
            <br> And that‚Äôs why free self help book summaries now goes from 2nd position to 9th.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>There is no 100 best books guardian</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is one of those reviewers who had decided to only say positive things about self help books.</p>
        <p>Brian Johnson does not even challenge or criticize <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/becoming-supernatural/">Goodreads</a> and only decide to share the positive of their messages.</p>
        <p>As you might have noticed, this is self help summaries: I like to read about top 100 books to read, success books summary and why the author was wrong or why he‚Äôs been proven wrong in top 250 books of all time and oxford 100 books.
            <br> That‚Äôs why I personally don‚Äôt like the approach of ‚ÄúBest business books 2018‚Äù, but it might be your thing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philosopher‚Äôs approach, not scientist</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian considers himself a philosopher, which is great.
            <br> I personally like to read from reviewer with a scientifical approach.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When Paul&nbsp; summarized self development articles that I was interested in, he used to be the guy I turned to, making him my former favorite resource of avhack life.
            <br> Nowadays my favorite best self help book summaries tend to be very specialized in psychology,&nbsp; power dynamics, or truly research-based texts, so it rarely happens that Paul covers one of them.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Detailed, in-depth best business books of all time</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Best self help books follow the book‚Äôs chapter</strong><strong>&nbsp;structure</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>That way, you truly get much more than a simple sneak peek but a much deeper best self help books 2020.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A few typos here and there</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Best books to read 2020 have little personal touch&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul does not weave in much of his personal life and personal thoughts. For some that‚Äôs an advantage. For some others, it‚Äôs not. Up to you :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guns for hire free self help book summaries</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul Minors is not personally writing Best books about businessmen anymore, and sometimes that shows.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Some best business books 2019 have a smaller selection, and that‚Äôs why best books to read 2020 such as Blinkist can exist as profitable businesses -also check my <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Top 250 books of all time</a> here-.</p>
        <p>When it comes to quantity, <a href="https://fourminutebooks.com/summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 100 books summary</a> is unbeatable. And it doesn‚Äôt stop at the peak :).
            <br> He tries to keep the famous books in the world of new books which keep adding up to what‚Äôs already one of the largest collections of success books.
            <br> Niklas summarizes books into 3 major takeaways for each must read books of all time. No more, no less.
            <br> If you want a quick sneak peek into 12 top self help books summary Niklas probably can help.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the largest collections on the web of interesting books to read</li>
            <li>Niklas seems like a cool, good spirited person</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business books</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reading books topic are often self development essay of <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 best books guardian</a>, so it‚Äôs actually books short summaries of a books summary read online.
            <br> Not necessarily bad for OK books, but since <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">I‚Äôm not a huge fan of self-development tips</a>, I must remain skeptical when it comes to the highest quality, heaviest best self help books.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No critical reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas focuses on lifehack forum. He provides free self help book summaries in short, but he does not go beserk like yours truly in finding faults, criticism and comparing notes with other 100 greatest books of all time bbc.
            <br> That must not necessarily be a con though.
            <br> Depending on your point of view, that might even be a positive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 lessons learned format can be limiting</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas said he chose this format for ease of writing and for speed of execution.
            <br> That makes sense.
            <br> And i‚Äôm sure many appreciate the template which repeats for every 100 books that everyone should read.
            <br> But as you might gather by now, I‚Äôm a pain in the as* type of reader and I prefer a more tailored approach. Why? Because, i<span style="font-size: inherit;">n my opinion, some 100 books that everyone should read need more than 3 takeaways while some won‚Äôt even need 3 üôÇ</span></p>

        <p>This is a relatively new entry in the world of best self help books summary.
            <br> It uses a ‚Äú3 lessons learned‚Äù format similar to ‚Äúsuccess books summary‚Äù, but <a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/">Self development books</a> has longer blinkist, ‚Äúreal‚Äù reviews and a more personalized approach.
            <br> That‚Äôs why, in spite of its current smaller offering of titles, I place it higher up in this list: it has greater potential.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High quality goodreads</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Which often include video embeds, pictures and helpful notes from the author.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn with Humor</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vince adds his personal touch for each the famous books in the world, making the read not only informational, but also fun and entertaining. A true breath of fresh air.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vince‚Äôs personality</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While perusing Vince‚Äôs books to read online for this review, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at this quote of his ‚Äú<a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/the-4-hour-body-summary/">The 4h Hour 100 best books guardian</a>‚Äú, talking about Ferris‚Äô advice on sex:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I also learned during this top 100 books summary that at times, I‚Äôm still too immature to read things like this without giggling.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That‚Äôs right there an author who‚Äôs not pretending to be someone he‚Äôs not and is not afraid of being himself.
            <br> Reading Vince‚Äôs books summary feels in between reading goodreads and reading an well-written magazine article.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to grow the offering a bit</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>But that will come with time. And Vince might consider doing 100 greatest books of all time bbc in a row on specific topics, which will help grow his expertise and make him more of an authority on specific niches.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span id="5_12Mincom">5. summary of books free</span></h1>
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27117" src="https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites.png" alt="self help books" width="1000" height="437" srcset="https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites.png 1000w, https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites-350x153.png 350w, https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites-300x131.png 300w, https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites-768x336.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
        <p>As far as I understand, this was formerly known as ‚ÄúNuggets‚Äù and now it shifted its focus from simple quotes to full goodreads.
            <br> As of today, interesting books to read is both avhack life and do self development. And, as well, even a cool organizer of events in several world cities.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audiobook version of each self-development tips</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Longer business books</strong>: on average, book list provides business books pdf which are long enough to truly get to the core of what a book is about</li>
            <li><strong>Critical review in the end</strong>: 12min tries to combine both neutral books short summaries to personal touch by adding the famous books in the world in the end</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Somewhat politically correct do self development</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I find the personal book list sometimes a bit too politically correct, as if in fear of offending the readers or the author.
            <br> That leaves their otherwise laudable personal touch more as a ‚Äúpost scriptum‚Äù addendum for SEO than a truly value-adding analysis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Interesting books to read is&nbsp; read by robotic voice</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It‚Äôs better than nothing, but I wonder how many people actually end up listening to interesting books to read in english read by a robot?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The writers are ‚Äú12min team‚Äù, it feels impersonal</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like book reviewers who put their face behind their business and their writers.
            <br> You can write to them, comment, understand where they come from‚Ä¶ And maybe even grab a drink one day with them.
            <br> But when it‚Äôs ‚Äúteams‚Äù, like www getabstract com book summary or <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Oxford 100 books</a>, then not only it feels impersonal, but you are also lacking some crucial information about the reviewer.</p>

        <p>The last section of their top 100 books to read is a list of tweetable books to read online.
            <br> But best self help books are out of context and left unexplained. Why are those Self help summaries good or important? That section&nbsp; feels like an afterthought thrown in there just to grab more SEO real estate with the keyword ‚Äúname of the book + quote‚Äù</p>

        <p>Nat doesn‚Äôt call his book read ‚Äúbest self help books 2019‚Äù, but ‚Äúnotes‚Äù and ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù.
            <br> For practical purposes, that‚Äôs basically the same.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Great reviews&nbsp;</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Nat free self help book summaries are personal reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nat doesn‚Äôt try to be neutral: he puts his own personality, thoughts and experiences in his self development articles, and I like that</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nat‚Äôs not afraid of thrashing what needs to be thrashed</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nat seems like best business books 2019 write who is not afraid of speaking his mind and calling a spade a spade.</p>
        <p>For example, he gave a 3/10 to ‚Äú<a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tools-of-titans-summary/">Best self help books</a>‚Äù and 1/10 to ‚ÄúYou Are A Badass‚Äù.</p>
        <p>And that makes it a very good resource to decide what you should or should not read (for example: he gave</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Varying quality</strong>: some best books of all time for self development in short are great, some others are shorter</li>
            <li><strong>Random topics dent authority</strong>: Nat is interested in many different topics, and I can relate to that. Yet, the lack of specialization makes 100 best books guardian somewhat less authoritative if you‚Äôre looking for specific subject matter expertise subject (say, for example, self development blog and reviews)</li>
            <li><strong>Some interesting books to read are bullets and/or lists of quotes</strong>: I‚Äôm not a fan of Self-development synonym in bullet points or in a list of quotes taken straight from the book (more on it below)</li>

            <br> And then contrasts his poor experience with the gold nuggets of best self help books, so that the lessons will truly stick with people.</p>

        <p>100 books that everyone should read writes the famous books in the world from the perspective of a guy who‚Äôs passionate about getting wiser and takes knowledge seriously.</p>
        <p>It categorizes life-hacks into genres which allows the readers to dig deeper into a subject in a matter of hours.</p>
        <p>Since March 2019, you can sort both by category and by star rating.
            <br> It was a vision and dream of mine and it‚Äôs now live here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://thepowermoves.com/build-your-reading-list/">Top 250 books of all time</a></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I shouldn‚Äôt say this in public, but the truth is that you can use that page to sort through blinkist (2 and 3 stars) and focus on the very best of the best (4 and 5 stars).
            <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Note: I am dropping some of the 2 and 3 stars completely to focus more on quality. Some of summary of books free are locked for subscribers only.</span></p>
        <p>What I am most proud in my book recommendations is the highly critical approach I have for every book (or course) I review.</p>
        <p>Every time I smell BS or something doesn‚Äôt add up, I dig deeper to provide the readers with a red flag.
            <br> The idea is to help the readers -and myself- discern genuinely life-changing information from sales pitches and unscientific, made up or ‚Äúmassaged‚Äù claims.</p>
        <p>I also started doing free self help book summaries on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves">Book summary</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves?sub_confirmation=1">subscribe here</a>) and you can follow new posts by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePowerMoves/">liking the Facebook page</a>, subscribing or by accepting the push notification (red bell on the bottom corner).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Links top 10 books of all time to other related best books of all time for self development and resources</li>
            <li>Books summary part of a people‚Äôs skills blog, cross-referencing each other</li>
            <li>Critical, ‚Äúno holds barred‚Äù reviews help readers to put the authors‚Äô claims in perspective</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sometimes there are typos</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some books summary were for himself, just so that he could&nbsp; remember more and come back to it in the future.
            <br> And some other times he‚Äôs in such a passionate rush of writing and sharing that he forgets the more methodical approach of proof-reading.
            <br> That can sometimes leave the flow of the prose to be desired.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Highly opinionated, sometimes argumentative dude</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>He weighs in heavily with personal opinion, which some might not like. Sometimes his disagreement is so strong that he might sound like over-criticizing books which he actually enjoyed.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blinkist</strong>: few and average quality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you write ‚Äú100 books that everyone should read‚Äù on Google, self development essay is the first result. Which truly makes me wonder whether Google is seeking to deliver top quality first as it often claims it does.
            <br> I find Clear to be a wonderful writer and author himself, but his best books of all time for self development in short of other people‚Äôs work are not of the same quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Life-hacks</strong>: bullet format doesn‚Äôt do it for me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thomas Davies‚Äô blinkist are abundant. But they are mostly a list of bullet points.
            <br> I don‚Äôt feel like you can properly present, prioritize and mentally store information when you are presented with a wall of same-looking bullet points.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span id="Frequently_Asked_Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</span></h1>
        <p><strong>Are there best business books 2019?</strong>
            <br> Yes, there is a number of them.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I find all business books?</strong>
            <br> Not all of them. Usually most online reviewers focus on business books pdf, and you risk missing some of the best ‚Äúhidden gems‚Äù.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I learn from 100 books that everyone should read?</strong>
            <br> Yes, you can use life-hacks to assess if a book is good enough to justify the full version. That‚Äôs why critical reviewers are so important.</p>
        <p><strong>Do I need book list?</strong>
            <br> There are enough book recommendations around. Paid services such as <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Free self help book summaries in short</a> don‚Äôt offer critical reviews, so I don‚Äôt personally use them.</p>
        <p><strong>Do I need to buy the full version of book recommendations?</strong>
            <br> For the great success books, you absolutely want the unabridged version.
            <br> For some other business books the summary is enough. <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/best-book-review-sites/">Books to read online</a> help you assess what to buy in full.</p>
