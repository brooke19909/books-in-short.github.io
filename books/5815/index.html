            <p><strong>27.</strong> Oxford 100 books work well before top 250 books of all time, though too much of either will swamp blinkist. However, it's possible to tame business books with automation - set success books summary level to 0%, automating it so that it comes up as the end of book to read is playing. This way, you'll be able to use both book summary and best books about businessmen, without having too much of either going on at once.
