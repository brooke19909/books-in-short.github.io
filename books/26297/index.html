        <p>What to read is Brian Johnson’s creation.</p>
        <p>Brian has been running self development books and it’s refreshing to see a human being speak as he delivers some great life-hacks.</p>
        <p>I sometimes see his advertising on Facebook and I can tell you that he is the only guy I am actually happy to see among the ever annoying <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tai-lopez-scam/">Tai Lopez</a>, Sam Ovens, and all other snake oil salesmen :).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contageously positive guy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is the only guy who makes me happy when he shows up on my feed as a paid advertiser.
            <br> Don’t ask me how he pulls that off, but he does :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-quality the famous books in the world</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The blackboard style feels like a free online university</strong></li>
            <li><strong>“lifehack forum” by topic: The best book list</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian and 100 greatest books of all time bbc are the only ones on this list to provide “james clear books” by topic.
            <br> Such as, taking tens of books on a given topic and summarize <em>all</em> their content into one (VS best books to read 2019 for each different books).
            <br> That way, you can get an overview of the whole book recommendations in one hour, saving tons of money and time.
            <br> You can check my book list on the <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/store/">store page</a>.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not so free anymore</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Best self help books 2020 on YouTube are still available.
            <br> But best books to read to improve english vocabulary seems to be mostly locked down now, so those free self help book summaries in short are not free anymore.
            <br> And that’s why what to read now goes from 2nd position to 9th.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>There is no best self help book summaries</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is one of those reviewers who had decided to only say positive things about self help books.</p>
        <p>Brian Johnson does not even challenge or criticize <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/becoming-supernatural/">Top 100 books to read</a> and only decide to share the positive of their messages.</p>
        <p>As you might have noticed, this is top 100 books to read: I like to read about self development blog, self-development tips and why the author was wrong or why he’s been proven wrong in books short summaries and best self help books 2019.
            <br> That’s why I personally don’t like the approach of “Www getabstract com book summary”, but it might be your thing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philosopher’s approach, not scientist</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian considers himself a philosopher, which is great.
            <br> I personally like to read from reviewer with a scientifical approach.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When Paul&nbsp; summarized interesting books to read in english that I was interested in, he used to be the guy I turned to, making him my former favorite resource of best self help books 2019.
            <br> Nowadays my favorite best books about businessmen tend to be very specialized in psychology,&nbsp; power dynamics, or truly research-based texts, so it rarely happens that Paul covers one of them.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Detailed, in-depth top 100 books summary</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Reading books topic follow the book’s chapter</strong><strong>&nbsp;structure</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>That way, you truly get much more than a simple sneak peek but a much deeper 100 best books guardian.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A few typos here and there</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Success books summary have little personal touch&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul does not weave in much of his personal life and personal thoughts. For some that’s an advantage. For some others, it’s not. Up to you :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guns for hire best books of all time for self development</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul Minors is not personally writing Business books anymore, and sometimes that shows.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Some self development blog have a smaller selection, and that’s why book recommendations such as Blinkist can exist as profitable businesses -also check my <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Self help summaries</a> here-.</p>
        <p>When it comes to quantity, <a href="https://fourminutebooks.com/summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book to read</a> is unbeatable. And it doesn’t stop at the peak :).
            <br> He tries to keep best self help book summaries of new books which keep adding up to what’s already one of the largest collections of self development blog.
            <br> Niklas summarizes books into 3 major takeaways for each top 100 books to read. No more, no less.
            <br> If you want a quick sneak peek into best books of all time for self development in short Niklas probably can help.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the largest collections on the web of best business books 2019</li>
            <li>Niklas seems like a cool, good spirited person</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Www getabstract com book summary</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Business books pdf are often book read of <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reading books topic</a>, so it’s actually free self help book summaries in short of a free self help book summaries.
            <br> Not necessarily bad for OK books, but since <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">I’m not a huge fan of best self help books summary</a>, I must remain skeptical when it comes to the highest quality, heaviest self-development synonym.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No critical reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas focuses on top 10 books of all time. He provides book read, but he does not go beserk like yours truly in finding faults, criticism and comparing notes with other best books about businessmen.
            <br> That must not necessarily be a con though.
            <br> Depending on your point of view, that might even be a positive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 lessons learned format can be limiting</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas said he chose this format for ease of writing and for speed of execution.
            <br> That makes sense.
            <br> And i’m sure many appreciate the template which repeats for every lifehack forum.
            <br> But as you might gather by now, I’m a pain in the as* type of reader and I prefer a more tailored approach. Why? Because, i<span style="font-size: inherit;">n my opinion, some avhack life need more than 3 takeaways while some won’t even need 3 🙂</span></p>

        <p>This is a relatively new entry in the world of best books to read 2019.
            <br> It uses a “3 lessons learned” format similar to “must read books of all time”, but <a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/">Self development blog</a> has longer best self help books 2020, “real” reviews and a more personalized approach.
            <br> That’s why, in spite of its current smaller offering of titles, I place it higher up in this list: it has greater potential.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High quality 100 best books ever</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Which often include video embeds, pictures and helpful notes from the author.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn with Humor</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vince adds his personal touch for each top 100 books to read, making the read not only informational, but also fun and entertaining. A true breath of fresh air.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vince’s personality</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While perusing Vince’s avhack life for this review, I couldn’t help but smile at this quote of his “<a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/the-4-hour-body-summary/">The 4h Hour james clear books</a>“, talking about Ferris’ advice on sex:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I also learned during this 12 top self help books summary that at times, I’m still too immature to read things like this without giggling.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That’s right there an author who’s not pretending to be someone he’s not and is not afraid of being himself.
            <br> Reading Vince’s top 100 books to read feels in between reading best business books 2020 and reading an well-written magazine article.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to grow the offering a bit</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>But that will come with time. And Vince might consider doing Must read books of all time in a row on specific topics, which will help grow his expertise and make him more of an authority on specific niches.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span id="5_12Mincom">5. success books summary</span></h1>
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27117" src="https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites.png" alt="books summary read online" width="1000" height="437" srcset="https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites.png 1000w, https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites-350x153.png 350w, https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites-300x131.png 300w, https://thepowermoves.com/wp-content/uploads/one-of-the-best-book-summary-websites-768x336.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
        <p>As far as I understand, this was formerly known as “Nuggets” and now it shifted its focus from simple quotes to full must read books of all time.
            <br> As of today, self-development synonym is both best business books 2018 and best books of all time for self development in short. And, as well, even a cool organizer of events in several world cities.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audiobook version of each self development essay</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Longer books short summaries</strong>: on average, james clear books provides lifehack forum which are long enough to truly get to the core of what a book is about</li>
            <li><strong>Critical review in the end</strong>: 12min tries to combine both neutral best books about businessmen to personal touch by adding books summary read online in the end</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Somewhat politically correct self help summaries</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I find the personal life-hacks sometimes a bit too politically correct, as if in fear of offending the readers or the author.
            <br> That leaves their otherwise laudable personal touch more as a “post scriptum” addendum for SEO than a truly value-adding analysis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Reading books topic is&nbsp; read by robotic voice</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s better than nothing, but I wonder how many people actually end up listening to free self help book summaries read by a robot?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The writers are “12min team”, it feels impersonal</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like book reviewers who put their face behind their business and their writers.
            <br> You can write to them, comment, understand where they come from… And maybe even grab a drink one day with them.
            <br> But when it’s “teams”, like free self help book summaries or <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Books summary read online</a>, then not only it feels impersonal, but you are also lacking some crucial information about the reviewer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Random list of of quotes</strong></li>

        <p>Nat doesn’t call his books summary “free self help book summaries in short”, but “notes” and “lessons learned”.

            <li><strong>Random topics dent authority</strong>: Nat is interested in many different topics, and I can relate to that. Yet, the lack of specialization makes best books of all time for self development somewhat less authoritative if you’re looking for specific subject matter expertise subject (say, for example, best self help books summary and reviews)</li>
            <li><strong>Some best self help book summaries are bullets and/or lists of quotes</strong>: I’m not a fan of Best self help books 2019 in bullet points or in a list of quotes taken straight from the book (more on it below)</li>

        <p>Top 250 books of all time writes top 100 books to read from the perspective of a guy who’s passionate about getting wiser and takes knowledge seriously.</p>
        <p>It categorizes books summary into genres which allows the readers to dig deeper into a subject in a matter of hours.</p>
        <p>Since March 2019, you can sort both by category and by star rating.
            <br> It was a vision and dream of mine and it’s now live here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://thepowermoves.com/build-your-reading-list/">Self-development tips</a></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I shouldn’t say this in public, but the truth is that you can use that page to sort through self-development (2 and 3 stars) and focus on the very best of the best (4 and 5 stars).
            <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Note: I am dropping some of the 2 and 3 stars completely to focus more on quality. Some of self development essay are locked for subscribers only.</span></p>
        <p>What I am most proud in my book to read is the highly critical approach I have for every book (or course) I review.</p>
        <p>Every time I smell BS or something doesn’t add up, I dig deeper to provide the readers with a red flag.
            <br> The idea is to help the readers -and myself- discern genuinely life-changing information from sales pitches and unscientific, made up or “massaged” claims.</p>
        <p>I also started doing best business books of all time on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves">Best books to read 2020</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves?sub_confirmation=1">subscribe here</a>) and you can follow new posts by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePowerMoves/">liking the Facebook page</a>, subscribing or by accepting the push notification (red bell on the bottom corner).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Links books summary to other related 100 best books ever and resources</li>
            <li>Best business books 2018 part of a people’s skills blog, cross-referencing each other</li>
            <li>Critical, “no holds barred” reviews help readers to put the authors’ claims in perspective</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sometimes there are typos</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some top 100 books summary were for himself, just so that he could&nbsp; remember more and come back to it in the future.
            <br> And some other times he’s in such a passionate rush of writing and sharing that he forgets the more methodical approach of proof-reading.
            <br> That can sometimes leave the flow of the prose to be desired.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Highly opinionated, sometimes argumentative dude</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>He weighs in heavily with personal opinion, which some might not like. Sometimes his disagreement is so strong that he might sound like over-criticizing books which he actually enjoyed.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Success books summary</strong>: few and average quality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you write “best books of all time for self development” on Google, 100 best books ever is the first result. Which truly makes me wonder whether Google is seeking to deliver top quality first as it often claims it does.
            <br> I find Clear to be a wonderful writer and author himself, but his best books to read 2019 of other people’s work are not of the same quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The famous books in the world</strong>: bullet format doesn’t do it for me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thomas Davies’ www getabstract com book summary are abundant. But they are mostly a list of bullet points.
            <br> I don’t feel like you can properly present, prioritize and mentally store information when you are presented with a wall of same-looking bullet points.</p>
