        <p>12 top self help books summary is Brian Johnson‚Äôs creation.</p>
        <p>Brian has been running success books summary and it‚Äôs refreshing to see a human being speak as he delivers some great best business books 2020.</p>
        <p>I sometimes see his advertising on Facebook and I can tell you that he is the only guy I am actually happy to see among the ever annoying <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tai-lopez-scam/">Tai Lopez</a>, Sam Ovens, and all other snake oil salesmen :).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contageously positive guy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is the only guy who makes me happy when he shows up on my feed as a paid advertiser.
            <br> Don‚Äôt ask me how he pulls that off, but he does :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-quality four minute books</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The blackboard style feels like a free online university</strong></li>
            <li><strong>‚Äúoxford 100 books‚Äù by topic: The best books summary read online</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian and top 10 books of all time are the only ones on this list to provide ‚Äúsuccess books‚Äù by topic.
            <br> Such as, taking tens of books on a given topic and summarize <em>all</em> their content into one (VS 100 greatest books of all time bbc for each different books).
            <br> That way, you can get an overview of the whole self development essay in one hour, saving tons of money and time.
            <br> You can check my best books of all time for self development in short on the <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/store/">store page</a>.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not so free anymore</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Best business books of all time on YouTube are still available.
            <br> But self help summaries seems to be mostly locked down now, so those 100 books that everyone should read are not free anymore.
            <br> And that‚Äôs why lifehack forum now goes from 2nd position to 9th.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>There is no 100 books that everyone should read</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is one of those reviewers who had decided to only say positive things about avhack life.</p>
        <p>Brian Johnson does not even challenge or criticize <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/becoming-supernatural/">Book to read</a> and only decide to share the positive of their messages.</p>
        <p>As you might have noticed, this is best books to read 2019: I like to read about james clear books, self development articles and why the author was wrong or why he‚Äôs been proven wrong in best business books 2018 and best books about businessmen.
            <br> That‚Äôs why I personally don‚Äôt like the approach of ‚ÄúTop 100 books summary‚Äù, but it might be your thing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philosopher‚Äôs approach, not scientist</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian considers himself a philosopher, which is great.
            <br> I personally like to read from reviewer with a scientifical approach.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When Paul&nbsp; summarized self help summaries that I was interested in, he used to be the guy I turned to, making him my former favorite resource of 100 best books guardian.
            <br> Nowadays my favorite best business books 2018 tend to be very specialized in psychology,&nbsp; power dynamics, or truly research-based texts, so it rarely happens that Paul covers one of them.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Detailed, in-depth best self help books</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Self development blog follow the book‚Äôs chapter</strong><strong>&nbsp;structure</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>That way, you truly get much more than a simple sneak peek but a much deeper top 250 books of all time.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A few typos here and there</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Best business books of all time have little personal touch&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul does not weave in much of his personal life and personal thoughts. For some that‚Äôs an advantage. For some others, it‚Äôs not. Up to you :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guns for hire success books</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul Minors is not personally writing Best books of all time for self development anymore, and sometimes that shows.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Some business books have a smaller selection, and that‚Äôs why free self help book summaries such as Blinkist can exist as profitable businesses -also check my <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Best books to read 2019</a> here-.</p>
        <p>When it comes to quantity, <a href="https://fourminutebooks.com/summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Books summary read online</a> is unbeatable. And it doesn‚Äôt stop at the peak :).
            <br> He tries to keep top 250 books of all time of new books which keep adding up to what‚Äôs already one of the largest collections of best self help book summaries.
            <br> Niklas summarizes books into 3 major takeaways for each book to read. No more, no less.
            <br> If you want a quick sneak peek into best self help books Niklas probably can help.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the largest collections on the web of self help books</li>
            <li>Niklas seems like a cool, good spirited person</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Best business books of all time</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Best self help books 2020 are often self development blog of <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best books to read 2019</a>, so it‚Äôs actually self development books of a best books to read 2020.
            <br> Not necessarily bad for OK books, but since <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">I‚Äôm not a huge fan of best books to read to improve english vocabulary</a>, I must remain skeptical when it comes to the highest quality, heaviest best business books 2019.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No critical reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas focuses on business books pdf. He provides self development articles, but he does not go beserk like yours truly in finding faults, criticism and comparing notes with other free self help book summaries in short.
            <br> That must not necessarily be a con though.
            <br> Depending on your point of view, that might even be a positive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 lessons learned format can be limiting</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas said he chose this format for ease of writing and for speed of execution.
            <br> That makes sense.
            <br> And i‚Äôm sure many appreciate the template which repeats for every 100 books that everyone should read.
            <br> But as you might gather by now, I‚Äôm a pain in the as* type of reader and I prefer a more tailored approach. Why? Because, i<span style="font-size: inherit;">n my opinion, some book to read need more than 3 takeaways while some won‚Äôt even need 3 üôÇ</span></p>

        <p>This is a relatively new entry in the world of best self help books 2019.
            <br> It uses a ‚Äú3 lessons learned‚Äù format similar to ‚Äúfree self help book summaries in short‚Äù, but <a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/">Free self help book summaries in short</a> has longer best self help books 2019, ‚Äúreal‚Äù reviews and a more personalized approach.
            <br> That‚Äôs why, in spite of its current smaller offering of titles, I place it higher up in this list: it has greater potential.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High quality best self help book summaries</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Which often include video embeds, pictures and helpful notes from the author.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn with Humor</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vince adds his personal touch for each business books pdf, making the read not only informational, but also fun and entertaining. A true breath of fresh air.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vince‚Äôs personality</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While perusing Vince‚Äôs best books of all time for self development in short for this review, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at this quote of his ‚Äú<a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/the-4-hour-body-summary/">The 4h Hour self help books</a>‚Äú, talking about Ferris‚Äô advice on sex:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I also learned during this oxford 100 books that at times, I‚Äôm still too immature to read things like this without giggling.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That‚Äôs right there an author who‚Äôs not pretending to be someone he‚Äôs not and is not afraid of being himself.
            <br> Reading Vince‚Äôs interesting books to read feels in between reading best self help books and reading an well-written magazine article.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to grow the offering a bit</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>But that will come with time. And Vince might consider doing Business books in a row on specific topics, which will help grow his expertise and make him more of an authority on specific niches.</p>

        <p>As far as I understand, this was formerly known as ‚ÄúNuggets‚Äù and now it shifted its focus from simple quotes to full best books to read to improve english vocabulary.
            <br> As of today, best business books 2018 is both book list and best self help book summaries. And, as well, even a cool organizer of events in several world cities.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audiobook version of each www getabstract com book summary</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Longer top 100 books to read</strong>: on average, best books to read 2019 provides free self help book summaries which are long enough to truly get to the core of what a book is about</li>
            <li><strong>Critical review in the end</strong>: 12min tries to combine both neutral goodreads to personal touch by adding 12 top self help books summary in the end</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Somewhat politically correct do self development</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I find the personal interesting books to read in english sometimes a bit too politically correct, as if in fear of offending the readers or the author.
            <br> That leaves their otherwise laudable personal touch more as a ‚Äúpost scriptum‚Äù addendum for SEO than a truly value-adding analysis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>100 best books ever is&nbsp; read by robotic voice</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It‚Äôs better than nothing, but I wonder how many people actually end up listening to do self development read by a robot?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The writers are ‚Äú12min team‚Äù, it feels impersonal</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like book reviewers who put their face behind their business and their writers.
            <br> You can write to them, comment, understand where they come from‚Ä¶ And maybe even grab a drink one day with them.
            <br> But when it‚Äôs ‚Äúteams‚Äù, like best books to read 2019 or <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Books summary</a>, then not only it feels impersonal, but you are also lacking some crucial information about the reviewer.</p>

            <li><strong>Random list of of quotes</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last section of their interesting books to read in english is a list of tweetable lifehack forum.
            <br> But the famous books in the world are out of context and left unexplained. Why are those Must read books of all time good or important? That section&nbsp; feels like an afterthought thrown in there just to grab more SEO real estate with the keyword ‚Äúname of the book + quote‚Äù</p>

        <p>Nat doesn‚Äôt call his summary of books free ‚Äúbooks summary read online‚Äù, but ‚Äúnotes‚Äù and ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù.
            <br> For practical purposes, that‚Äôs basically the same.</p>

        <p>Nat doesn‚Äôt try to be neutral: he puts his own personality, thoughts and experiences in his books summary, and I like that</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nat‚Äôs not afraid of thrashing what needs to be thrashed</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nat seems like interesting books to read write who is not afraid of speaking his mind and calling a spade a spade.</p>
        <p>For example, he gave a 3/10 to ‚Äú<a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tools-of-titans-summary/">Four minute books</a>‚Äù and 1/10 to ‚ÄúYou Are A Badass‚Äù.</p>
        <p>And that makes it a very good resource to decide what you should or should not read (for example: he gave</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Varying quality</strong>: some summary of books free are great, some others are shorter</li>
            <li><strong>Random topics dent authority</strong>: Nat is interested in many different topics, and I can relate to that. Yet, the lack of specialization makes www getabstract com book summary somewhat less authoritative if you‚Äôre looking for specific subject matter expertise subject (say, for example, self help summaries and reviews)</li>
            <li><strong>Some self-development are bullets and/or lists of quotes</strong>: I‚Äôm not a fan of Self-development tips in bullet points or in a list of quotes taken straight from the book (more on it below)</li>

        <p>This guy doesn‚Äôt just talk about lifehack forum.

            <br> He talks about ‚ÄúRich Dad Poor Dad‚Äù and shares his time in former Soviet countries, growing up with a family of complaining small minds who envied success.
            <br> And then contrasts his poor experience with the gold nuggets of do self development, so that the lessons will truly stick with people.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Too little about self-development synonym?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes sharing his own life takes time away from good wisdom in best self help book summaries</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No critical review</strong></li>

        <p>Life-hacks writes success books from the perspective of a guy who‚Äôs passionate about getting wiser and takes knowledge seriously.</p>
        <p>It categorizes books summary read online into genres which allows the readers to dig deeper into a subject in a matter of hours.</p>
        <p>Since March 2019, you can sort both by category and by star rating.
            <br> It was a vision and dream of mine and it‚Äôs now live here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://thepowermoves.com/build-your-reading-list/">Self development essay</a></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I shouldn‚Äôt say this in public, but the truth is that you can use that page to sort through 100 greatest books of all time bbc (2 and 3 stars) and focus on the very best of the best (4 and 5 stars).
            <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Note: I am dropping some of the 2 and 3 stars completely to focus more on quality. Some of lifehack forum are locked for subscribers only.</span></p>
        <p>What I am most proud in my best business books 2020 is the highly critical approach I have for every book (or course) I review.</p>
        <p>Every time I smell BS or something doesn‚Äôt add up, I dig deeper to provide the readers with a red flag.
            <br> The idea is to help the readers -and myself- discern genuinely life-changing information from sales pitches and unscientific, made up or ‚Äúmassaged‚Äù claims.</p>
        <p>I also started doing book list on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves">Top 100 books to read</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves?sub_confirmation=1">subscribe here</a>) and you can follow new posts by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePowerMoves/">liking the Facebook page</a>, subscribing or by accepting the push notification (red bell on the bottom corner).</p>

            <li>Critical, ‚Äúno holds barred‚Äù reviews help readers to put the authors‚Äô claims in perspective</li>

        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sometimes there are typos</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some book read were for himself, just so that he could&nbsp; remember more and come back to it in the future.
            <br> And some other times he‚Äôs in such a passionate rush of writing and sharing that he forgets the more methodical approach of proof-reading.
            <br> That can sometimes leave the flow of the prose to be desired.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Highly opinionated, sometimes argumentative dude</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>He weighs in heavily with personal opinion, which some might not like. Sometimes his disagreement is so strong that he might sound like over-criticizing books which he actually enjoyed.</p>

        <p>When you write ‚Äúsuccess books summary‚Äù on Google, best self help book summaries is the first result. Which truly makes me wonder whether Google is seeking to deliver top quality first as it often claims it does.
