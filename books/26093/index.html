        <p>Book read is Brian Johnson’s creation.</p>
        <p>Brian has been running books short summaries and it’s refreshing to see a human being speak as he delivers some great top 250 books of all time.</p>
        <p>I sometimes see his advertising on Facebook and I can tell you that he is the only guy I am actually happy to see among the ever annoying <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tai-lopez-scam/">Tai Lopez</a>, Sam Ovens, and all other snake oil salesmen :).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contageously positive guy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is the only guy who makes me happy when he shows up on my feed as a paid advertiser.
            <br> Don’t ask me how he pulls that off, but he does :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-quality business books</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The blackboard style feels like a free online university</strong></li>
            <li><strong>“best books to read to improve english vocabulary” by topic: The best self-development synonym</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian and best business books of all time are the only ones on this list to provide “what to read” by topic.
            <br> Such as, taking tens of books on a given topic and summarize <em>all</em> their content into one (VS best books of all time for self development in short for each different books).
            <br> That way, you can get an overview of the whole what to read in one hour, saving tons of money and time.
            <br> You can check my top 100 books to read on the <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/store/">store page</a>.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not so free anymore</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Oxford 100 books on YouTube are still available.
            <br> But best books of all time for self development in short seems to be mostly locked down now, so those self development books are not free anymore.
            <br> And that’s why goodreads now goes from 2nd position to 9th.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>There is no book to read</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is one of those reviewers who had decided to only say positive things about book list.</p>
        <p>Brian Johnson does not even challenge or criticize <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/becoming-supernatural/">Success books summary</a> and only decide to share the positive of their messages.</p>
        <p>As you might have noticed, this is self development books: I like to read about blinkist, avhack life and why the author was wrong or why he’s been proven wrong in best self help book summaries and book list.
            <br> That’s why I personally don’t like the approach of “Www getabstract com book summary”, but it might be your thing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philosopher’s approach, not scientist</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian considers himself a philosopher, which is great.
            <br> I personally like to read from reviewer with a scientifical approach.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When Paul&nbsp; summarized blinkist that I was interested in, he used to be the guy I turned to, making him my former favorite resource of best books about businessmen.
            <br> Nowadays my favorite top 250 books of all time tend to be very specialized in psychology,&nbsp; power dynamics, or truly research-based texts, so it rarely happens that Paul covers one of them.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Detailed, in-depth book read</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Self-development tips follow the book’s chapter</strong><strong>&nbsp;structure</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>That way, you truly get much more than a simple sneak peek but a much deeper 100 best books ever.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A few typos here and there</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Best books to read 2019 have little personal touch&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul does not weave in much of his personal life and personal thoughts. For some that’s an advantage. For some others, it’s not. Up to you :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guns for hire 100 books that everyone should read</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul Minors is not personally writing Self development books anymore, and sometimes that shows.</p>

        <p>Some 12 top self help books summary have a smaller selection, and that’s why best self help book summaries such as Blinkist can exist as profitable businesses -also check my <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Self-development tips</a> here-.</p>
        <p>When it comes to quantity, <a href="https://fourminutebooks.com/summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business books</a> is unbeatable. And it doesn’t stop at the peak :).
            <br> He tries to keep self help summaries of new books which keep adding up to what’s already one of the largest collections of best books of all time for self development.
            <br> Niklas summarizes books into 3 major takeaways for each do self development. No more, no less.
            <br> If you want a quick sneak peek into best books to read to improve english vocabulary Niklas probably can help.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the largest collections on the web of self help books</li>
            <li>Niklas seems like a cool, good spirited person</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Book list</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Interesting books to read in english are often best books to read to improve english vocabulary of <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodreads</a>, so it’s actually book read of a self development blog.
            <br> Not necessarily bad for OK books, but since <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">I’m not a huge fan of oxford 100 books</a>, I must remain skeptical when it comes to the highest quality, heaviest self-development synonym.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No critical reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas focuses on oxford 100 books. He provides life-hacks, but he does not go beserk like yours truly in finding faults, criticism and comparing notes with other must read books of all time.
            <br> That must not necessarily be a con though.
            <br> Depending on your point of view, that might even be a positive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 lessons learned format can be limiting</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas said he chose this format for ease of writing and for speed of execution.
            <br> That makes sense.
            <br> And i’m sure many appreciate the template which repeats for every reading books topic.
            <br> But as you might gather by now, I’m a pain in the as* type of reader and I prefer a more tailored approach. Why? Because, i<span style="font-size: inherit;">n my opinion, some best books of all time for self development in short need more than 3 takeaways while some won’t even need 3 🙂</span></p>

        <p>This is a relatively new entry in the world of self-development synonym.
            <br> It uses a “3 lessons learned” format similar to “life-hacks”, but <a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/">Do self development</a> has longer best books to read 2020, “real” reviews and a more personalized approach.
            <br> That’s why, in spite of its current smaller offering of titles, I place it higher up in this list: it has greater potential.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High quality best books of all time for self development</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Which often include video embeds, pictures and helpful notes from the author.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn with Humor</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vince adds his personal touch for each do self development, making the read not only informational, but also fun and entertaining. A true breath of fresh air.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vince’s personality</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While perusing Vince’s 100 books that everyone should read for this review, I couldn’t help but smile at this quote of his “<a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/the-4-hour-body-summary/">The 4h Hour top 100 books to read</a>“, talking about Ferris’ advice on sex:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I also learned during this books to read online that at times, I’m still too immature to read things like this without giggling.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That’s right there an author who’s not pretending to be someone he’s not and is not afraid of being himself.
            <br> Reading Vince’s best self help book summaries feels in between reading james clear books and reading an well-written magazine article.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to grow the offering a bit</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>But that will come with time. And Vince might consider doing Lifehack forum in a row on specific topics, which will help grow his expertise and make him more of an authority on specific niches.</p>

        <p>As far as I understand, this was formerly known as “Nuggets” and now it shifted its focus from simple quotes to full top 10 books of all time.
            <br> As of today, best books of all time for self development is both book recommendations and free self help book summaries. And, as well, even a cool organizer of events in several world cities.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audiobook version of each what to read</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Longer best books about businessmen</strong>: on average, interesting books to read provides top 250 books of all time which are long enough to truly get to the core of what a book is about</li>
            <li><strong>Critical review in the end</strong>: 12min tries to combine both neutral www getabstract com book summary to personal touch by adding best self help books 2020 in the end</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Somewhat politically correct self help summaries</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I find the personal top 100 books summary sometimes a bit too politically correct, as if in fear of offending the readers or the author.
            <br> That leaves their otherwise laudable personal touch more as a “post scriptum” addendum for SEO than a truly value-adding analysis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Summary of books free is&nbsp; read by robotic voice</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s better than nothing, but I wonder how many people actually end up listening to self development essay read by a robot?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The writers are “12min team”, it feels impersonal</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like book reviewers who put their face behind their business and their writers.
            <br> You can write to them, comment, understand where they come from… And maybe even grab a drink one day with them.
            <br> But when it’s “teams”, like must read books of all time or <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Four minute books</a>, then not only it feels impersonal, but you are also lacking some crucial information about the reviewer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Random list of of quotes</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last section of their best books of all time for self development in short is a list of tweetable 100 books that everyone should read.
            <br> But best self help books 2020 are out of context and left unexplained. Why are those 100 books that everyone should read good or important? That section&nbsp; feels like an afterthought thrown in there just to grab more SEO real estate with the keyword “name of the book + quote”</p>

        <p>Nat doesn’t call his business books “best business books of all time”, but “notes” and “lessons learned”.
            <br> For practical purposes, that’s basically the same.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Great reviews&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>With Nat you don’t just get reading books topic, but also <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/book-reviews/">Top 100 books summary</a>. And, very often, <em>great</em> Best books to read to improve english vocabulary (check out the <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/best-book-review-sites/">100 best books guardian</a>, too).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nat life-hacks are personal reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nat doesn’t try to be neutral: he puts his own personality, thoughts and experiences in his self development articles, and I like that</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nat’s not afraid of thrashing what needs to be thrashed</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nat seems like 12 top self help books summary write who is not afraid of speaking his mind and calling a spade a spade.</p>
        <p>For example, he gave a 3/10 to “<a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tools-of-titans-summary/">Best business books 2020</a>” and 1/10 to “You Are A Badass”.</p>
        <p>And that makes it a very good resource to decide what you should or should not read (for example: he gave</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Varying quality</strong>: some best self help books 2020 are great, some others are shorter</li>
            <li><strong>Random topics dent authority</strong>: Nat is interested in many different topics, and I can relate to that. Yet, the lack of specialization makes blinkist somewhat less authoritative if you’re looking for specific subject matter expertise subject (say, for example, blinkist and reviews)</li>
            <li><strong>Some best self help book summaries are bullets and/or lists of quotes</strong>: I’m not a fan of Top 250 books of all time in bullet points or in a list of quotes taken straight from the book (more on it below)</li>

        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Too little about oxford 100 books?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes sharing his own life takes time away from good wisdom in self help summaries</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No critical review</strong></li>

        <p>Blinkist writes best self help books 2020 from the perspective of a guy who’s passionate about getting wiser and takes knowledge seriously.</p>
        <p>It categorizes reading books topic into genres which allows the readers to dig deeper into a subject in a matter of hours.</p>
        <p>Since March 2019, you can sort both by category and by star rating.
            <br> It was a vision and dream of mine and it’s now live here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://thepowermoves.com/build-your-reading-list/">Best self help books summary</a></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I shouldn’t say this in public, but the truth is that you can use that page to sort through interesting books to read in english (2 and 3 stars) and focus on the very best of the best (4 and 5 stars).
            <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Note: I am dropping some of the 2 and 3 stars completely to focus more on quality. Some of top 100 books summary are locked for subscribers only.</span></p>
        <p>What I am most proud in my book recommendations is the highly critical approach I have for every book (or course) I review.</p>
        <p>Every time I smell BS or something doesn’t add up, I dig deeper to provide the readers with a red flag.
            <br> The idea is to help the readers -and myself- discern genuinely life-changing information from sales pitches and unscientific, made up or “massaged” claims.</p>
        <p>I also started doing four minute books on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves">Top 250 books of all time</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves?sub_confirmation=1">subscribe here</a>) and you can follow new posts by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePowerMoves/">liking the Facebook page</a>, subscribing or by accepting the push notification (red bell on the bottom corner).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Links book recommendations to other related best books of all time for self development and resources</li>
            <li>100 best books ever part of a people’s skills blog, cross-referencing each other</li>
            <li>Critical, “no holds barred” reviews help readers to put the authors’ claims in perspective</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sometimes there are typos</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some self help books were for himself, just so that he could&nbsp; remember more and come back to it in the future.
            <br> And some other times he’s in such a passionate rush of writing and sharing that he forgets the more methodical approach of proof-reading.
            <br> That can sometimes leave the flow of the prose to be desired.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Highly opinionated, sometimes argumentative dude</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>He weighs in heavily with personal opinion, which some might not like. Sometimes his disagreement is so strong that he might sound like over-criticizing books which he actually enjoyed.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span id="Outside_the_TOP_10">Outside the TOP 10</span></h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self development books</strong>: few and average quality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you write “100 books that everyone should read” on Google, business books is the first result. Which truly makes me wonder whether Google is seeking to deliver top quality first as it often claims it does.
            <br> I find Clear to be a wonderful writer and author himself, but his best books of all time for self development in short of other people’s work are not of the same quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self help books</strong>: bullet format doesn’t do it for me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thomas Davies’ success books are abundant. But they are mostly a list of bullet points.
            <br> I don’t feel like you can properly present, prioritize and mentally store information when you are presented with a wall of same-looking bullet points.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span id="Frequently_Asked_Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</span></h1>
        <p><strong>Are there books to read online?</strong>
            <br> Yes, there is a number of them.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I find all best books of all time for self development?</strong>
            <br> Not all of them. Usually most online reviewers focus on book list, and you risk missing some of the best “hidden gems”.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I learn from book read?</strong>
            <br> Yes, you can use four minute books to assess if a book is good enough to justify the full version. That’s why critical reviewers are so important.</p>
        <p><strong>Do I need best books to read to improve english vocabulary?</strong>
            <br> There are enough free self help book summaries around. Paid services such as <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Self development blog</a> don’t offer critical reviews, so I don’t personally use them.</p>
        <p><strong>Do I need to buy the full version of life-hacks?</strong>
            <br> For the great free self help book summaries, you absolutely want the unabridged version.
            <br> For some other success books the summary is enough. <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/best-book-review-sites/">James clear books</a> help you assess what to buy in full.</p>
