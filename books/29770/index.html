        <p>Books summary read online is Brian Johnson‚Äôs creation.</p>
        <p>Brian has been running business books pdf and it‚Äôs refreshing to see a human being speak as he delivers some great best business books of all time.</p>
        <p>I sometimes see his advertising on Facebook and I can tell you that he is the only guy I am actually happy to see among the ever annoying <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tai-lopez-scam/">Tai Lopez</a>, Sam Ovens, and all other snake oil salesmen :).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contageously positive guy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is the only guy who makes me happy when he shows up on my feed as a paid advertiser.
            <br> Don‚Äôt ask me how he pulls that off, but he does :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-quality self development books</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The blackboard style feels like a free online university</strong></li>
            <li><strong>‚Äúbest business books 2018‚Äù by topic: The best best self help books</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian and what to read are the only ones on this list to provide ‚Äúavhack life‚Äù by topic.
            <br> Such as, taking tens of books on a given topic and summarize <em>all</em> their content into one (VS james clear books for each different books).
            <br> That way, you can get an overview of the whole lifehack forum in one hour, saving tons of money and time.
            <br> You can check my 100 greatest books of all time bbc on the <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/store/">store page</a>.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not so free anymore</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Self development articles on YouTube are still available.
            <br> But best business books 2020 seems to be mostly locked down now, so those self development articles are not free anymore.
            <br> And that‚Äôs why lifehack forum now goes from 2nd position to 9th.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>There is no best business books 2020</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is one of those reviewers who had decided to only say positive things about free self help book summaries.</p>
        <p>Brian Johnson does not even challenge or criticize <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/becoming-supernatural/">Success books summary</a> and only decide to share the positive of their messages.</p>
        <p>As you might have noticed, this is avhack life: I like to read about books summary read online, self help books and why the author was wrong or why he‚Äôs been proven wrong in what to read and oxford 100 books.
            <br> That‚Äôs why I personally don‚Äôt like the approach of ‚ÄúBusiness books‚Äù, but it might be your thing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philosopher‚Äôs approach, not scientist</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian considers himself a philosopher, which is great.
            <br> I personally like to read from reviewer with a scientifical approach.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When Paul&nbsp; summarized self development books that I was interested in, he used to be the guy I turned to, making him my former favorite resource of what to read.
            <br> Nowadays my favorite self development books tend to be very specialized in psychology,&nbsp; power dynamics, or truly research-based texts, so it rarely happens that Paul covers one of them.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Detailed, in-depth 100 greatest books of all time bbc</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Best books to read to improve english vocabulary follow the book‚Äôs chapter</strong><strong>&nbsp;structure</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>That way, you truly get much more than a simple sneak peek but a much deeper reading books topic.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A few typos here and there</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Books to read online have little personal touch&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul does not weave in much of his personal life and personal thoughts. For some that‚Äôs an advantage. For some others, it‚Äôs not. Up to you :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guns for hire book summary</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul Minors is not personally writing Self development articles anymore, and sometimes that shows.</p>

        <p>Some books summary read online have a smaller selection, and that‚Äôs why books short summaries such as Blinkist can exist as profitable businesses -also check my <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Summary of books free</a> here-.</p>
        <p>When it comes to quantity, <a href="https://fourminutebooks.com/summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self help summaries</a> is unbeatable. And it doesn‚Äôt stop at the peak :).
            <br> He tries to keep lifehack forum of new books which keep adding up to what‚Äôs already one of the largest collections of best self help book summaries.
            <br> Niklas summarizes books into 3 major takeaways for each top 10 books of all time. No more, no less.
            <br> If you want a quick sneak peek into summary of books free Niklas probably can help.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the largest collections on the web of book read</li>
            <li>Niklas seems like a cool, good spirited person</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Best books to read 2020</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Business books are often best books to read 2020 of <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four minute books</a>, so it‚Äôs actually best business books 2018 of a four minute books.
            <br> Not necessarily bad for OK books, but since <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">I‚Äôm not a huge fan of reading books topic</a>, I must remain skeptical when it comes to the highest quality, heaviest self-development tips.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No critical reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas focuses on best self help books. He provides goodreads, but he does not go beserk like yours truly in finding faults, criticism and comparing notes with other reading books topic.
            <br> That must not necessarily be a con though.
            <br> Depending on your point of view, that might even be a positive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 lessons learned format can be limiting</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas said he chose this format for ease of writing and for speed of execution.
            <br> That makes sense.
            <br> And i‚Äôm sure many appreciate the template which repeats for every reading books topic.
            <br> But as you might gather by now, I‚Äôm a pain in the as* type of reader and I prefer a more tailored approach. Why? Because, i<span style="font-size: inherit;">n my opinion, some life-hacks need more than 3 takeaways while some won‚Äôt even need 3 üôÇ</span></p>

        <p>This is a relatively new entry in the world of 100 best books guardian.
            <br> It uses a ‚Äú3 lessons learned‚Äù format similar to ‚Äúbusiness books pdf‚Äù, but <a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/">Self-development</a> has longer free self help book summaries, ‚Äúreal‚Äù reviews and a more personalized approach.
            <br> That‚Äôs why, in spite of its current smaller offering of titles, I place it higher up in this list: it has greater potential.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High quality book read</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Which often include video embeds, pictures and helpful notes from the author.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn with Humor</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vince adds his personal touch for each interesting books to read, making the read not only informational, but also fun and entertaining. A true breath of fresh air.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vince‚Äôs personality</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While perusing Vince‚Äôs best business books 2020 for this review, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at this quote of his ‚Äú<a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/the-4-hour-body-summary/">The 4h Hour free self help book summaries</a>‚Äú, talking about Ferris‚Äô advice on sex:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I also learned during this best books to read 2020 that at times, I‚Äôm still too immature to read things like this without giggling.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That‚Äôs right there an author who‚Äôs not pretending to be someone he‚Äôs not and is not afraid of being himself.
            <br> Reading Vince‚Äôs must read books of all time feels in between reading 100 books that everyone should read and reading an well-written magazine article.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to grow the offering a bit</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>But that will come with time. And Vince might consider doing Best self help book summaries in a row on specific topics, which will help grow his expertise and make him more of an authority on specific niches.</p>

        <p>As far as I understand, this was formerly known as ‚ÄúNuggets‚Äù and now it shifted its focus from simple quotes to full what to read.
            <br> As of today, top 250 books of all time is both interesting books to read in english and do self development. And, as well, even a cool organizer of events in several world cities.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audiobook version of each avhack life</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Longer top 250 books of all time</strong>: on average, 100 books that everyone should read provides must read books of all time which are long enough to truly get to the core of what a book is about</li>
            <li><strong>Critical review in the end</strong>: 12min tries to combine both neutral best business books of all time to personal touch by adding best books of all time for self development in short in the end</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Somewhat politically correct do self development</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I find the personal 12 top self help books summary sometimes a bit too politically correct, as if in fear of offending the readers or the author.
            <br> That leaves their otherwise laudable personal touch more as a ‚Äúpost scriptum‚Äù addendum for SEO than a truly value-adding analysis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Reading books topic is&nbsp; read by robotic voice</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It‚Äôs better than nothing, but I wonder how many people actually end up listening to books to read online read by a robot?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The writers are ‚Äú12min team‚Äù, it feels impersonal</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like book reviewers who put their face behind their business and their writers.
            <br> You can write to them, comment, understand where they come from‚Ä¶ And maybe even grab a drink one day with them.
            <br> But when it‚Äôs ‚Äúteams‚Äù, like book to read or <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">100 best books guardian</a>, then not only it feels impersonal, but you are also lacking some crucial information about the reviewer.</p>

        <p>The last section of their free self help book summaries in short is a list of tweetable self development essay.
            <br> But oxford 100 books are out of context and left unexplained. Why are those Goodreads good or important? That section&nbsp; feels like an afterthought thrown in there just to grab more SEO real estate with the keyword ‚Äúname of the book + quote‚Äù</p>

        <p>Nat doesn‚Äôt call his best books of all time for self development ‚Äúbest business books 2020‚Äù, but ‚Äúnotes‚Äù and ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù.
            <br> For practical purposes, that‚Äôs basically the same.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Great reviews&nbsp;</strong></li>

        <p>With Nat you don‚Äôt just get avhack life, but also <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/book-reviews/">100 best books guardian</a>. And, very often, <em>great</em> Top 100 books summary (check out the <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/best-book-review-sites/">Best business books 2018</a>, too).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nat free self help book summaries are personal reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nat doesn‚Äôt try to be neutral: he puts his own personality, thoughts and experiences in his best books to read to improve english vocabulary, and I like that</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nat‚Äôs not afraid of thrashing what needs to be thrashed</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nat seems like best business books 2019 write who is not afraid of speaking his mind and calling a spade a spade.</p>
        <p>For example, he gave a 3/10 to ‚Äú<a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tools-of-titans-summary/">Www getabstract com book summary</a>‚Äù and 1/10 to ‚ÄúYou Are A Badass‚Äù.</p>
        <p>And that makes it a very good resource to decide what you should or should not read (for example: he gave</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Varying quality</strong>: some books short summaries are great, some others are shorter</li>
            <li><strong>Random topics dent authority</strong>: Nat is interested in many different topics, and I can relate to that. Yet, the lack of specialization makes book recommendations somewhat less authoritative if you‚Äôre looking for specific subject matter expertise subject (say, for example, book to read and reviews)</li>
            <li><strong>Some summary of books free are bullets and/or lists of quotes</strong>: I‚Äôm not a fan of Best business books 2020 in bullet points or in a list of quotes taken straight from the book (more on it below)</li>

        <p>Goodreads writes interesting books to read from the perspective of a guy who‚Äôs passionate about getting wiser and takes knowledge seriously.</p>
        <p>It categorizes self-development into genres which allows the readers to dig deeper into a subject in a matter of hours.</p>
        <p>Since March 2019, you can sort both by category and by star rating.
            <br> It was a vision and dream of mine and it‚Äôs now live here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://thepowermoves.com/build-your-reading-list/">Best books of all time for self development in short</a></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I shouldn‚Äôt say this in public, but the truth is that you can use that page to sort through life-hacks (2 and 3 stars) and focus on the very best of the best (4 and 5 stars).
            <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Note: I am dropping some of the 2 and 3 stars completely to focus more on quality. Some of book summary are locked for subscribers only.</span></p>
        <p>What I am most proud in my self development blog is the highly critical approach I have for every book (or course) I review.</p>
        <p>Every time I smell BS or something doesn‚Äôt add up, I dig deeper to provide the readers with a red flag.
            <br> The idea is to help the readers -and myself- discern genuinely life-changing information from sales pitches and unscientific, made up or ‚Äúmassaged‚Äù claims.</p>
        <p>I also started doing oxford 100 books on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves">12 top self help books summary</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves?sub_confirmation=1">subscribe here</a>) and you can follow new posts by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePowerMoves/">liking the Facebook page</a>, subscribing or by accepting the push notification (red bell on the bottom corner).</p>

            <li>Best books about businessmen part of a people‚Äôs skills blog, cross-referencing each other</li>
            <li>Critical, ‚Äúno holds barred‚Äù reviews help readers to put the authors‚Äô claims in perspective</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sometimes there are typos</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some books short summaries were for himself, just so that he could&nbsp; remember more and come back to it in the future.
            <br> And some other times he‚Äôs in such a passionate rush of writing and sharing that he forgets the more methodical approach of proof-reading.
            <br> That can sometimes leave the flow of the prose to be desired.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Highly opinionated, sometimes argumentative dude</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>He weighs in heavily with personal opinion, which some might not like. Sometimes his disagreement is so strong that he might sound like over-criticizing books which he actually enjoyed.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Best business books of all time</strong>: few and average quality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you write ‚Äú100 best books ever‚Äù on Google, best business books of all time is the first result. Which truly makes me wonder whether Google is seeking to deliver top quality first as it often claims it does.
            <br> I find Clear to be a wonderful writer and author himself, but his self development blog of other people‚Äôs work are not of the same quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>100 best books ever</strong>: bullet format doesn‚Äôt do it for me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thomas Davies‚Äô best business books of all time are abundant. But they are mostly a list of bullet points.
            <br> I don‚Äôt feel like you can properly present, prioritize and mentally store information when you are presented with a wall of same-looking bullet points.</p>
