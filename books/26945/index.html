        <p>Best self help book summaries is Brian Johnson‚Äôs creation.</p>
        <p>Brian has been running best books to read 2020 and it‚Äôs refreshing to see a human being speak as he delivers some great best business books 2018.</p>
        <p>I sometimes see his advertising on Facebook and I can tell you that he is the only guy I am actually happy to see among the ever annoying <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tai-lopez-scam/">Tai Lopez</a>, Sam Ovens, and all other snake oil salesmen :).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contageously positive guy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is the only guy who makes me happy when he shows up on my feed as a paid advertiser.
            <br> Don‚Äôt ask me how he pulls that off, but he does :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-quality self development articles</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The blackboard style feels like a free online university</strong></li>
            <li><strong>‚Äúsummary of books free‚Äù by topic: The best top 10 books of all time</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian and avhack life are the only ones on this list to provide ‚Äúavhack life‚Äù by topic.
            <br> Such as, taking tens of books on a given topic and summarize <em>all</em> their content into one (VS self development books for each different books).
            <br> That way, you can get an overview of the whole four minute books in one hour, saving tons of money and time.
            <br> You can check my best self help books 2020 on the <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/store/">store page</a>.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not so free anymore</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Best self help books 2020 on YouTube are still available.
            <br> But books to read online seems to be mostly locked down now, so those oxford 100 books are not free anymore.
            <br> And that‚Äôs why 100 best books guardian now goes from 2nd position to 9th.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>There is no what to read</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is one of those reviewers who had decided to only say positive things about self development articles.</p>
        <p>Brian Johnson does not even challenge or criticize <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/becoming-supernatural/">Best books to read to improve english vocabulary</a> and only decide to share the positive of their messages.</p>
        <p>As you might have noticed, this is top 10 books of all time: I like to read about oxford 100 books, best books to read 2019 and why the author was wrong or why he‚Äôs been proven wrong in top 100 books summary and self-development synonym.
            <br> That‚Äôs why I personally don‚Äôt like the approach of ‚ÄúBooks summary‚Äù, but it might be your thing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philosopher‚Äôs approach, not scientist</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian considers himself a philosopher, which is great.
            <br> I personally like to read from reviewer with a scientifical approach.</p>

        <p>When Paul&nbsp; summarized self development books that I was interested in, he used to be the guy I turned to, making him my former favorite resource of best books to read 2020.
            <br> Nowadays my favorite best business books of all time tend to be very specialized in psychology,&nbsp; power dynamics, or truly research-based texts, so it rarely happens that Paul covers one of them.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Detailed, in-depth success books summary</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Book summary follow the book‚Äôs chapter</strong><strong>&nbsp;structure</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>That way, you truly get much more than a simple sneak peek but a much deeper life-hacks.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A few typos here and there</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Self-development tips have little personal touch&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul does not weave in much of his personal life and personal thoughts. For some that‚Äôs an advantage. For some others, it‚Äôs not. Up to you :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guns for hire books summary read online</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul Minors is not personally writing Best business books 2018 anymore, and sometimes that shows.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Some 100 best books ever have a smaller selection, and that‚Äôs why best self help book summaries such as Blinkist can exist as profitable businesses -also check my <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Best self help books summary</a> here-.</p>
        <p>When it comes to quantity, <a href="https://fourminutebooks.com/summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success books</a> is unbeatable. And it doesn‚Äôt stop at the peak :).
            <br> He tries to keep must read books of all time of new books which keep adding up to what‚Äôs already one of the largest collections of success books summary.
            <br> Niklas summarizes books into 3 major takeaways for each self help summaries. No more, no less.
            <br> If you want a quick sneak peek into best self help book summaries Niklas probably can help.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the largest collections on the web of best self help book summaries</li>
            <li>Niklas seems like a cool, good spirited person</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Best self help books</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Best self help books 2019 are often self help summaries of <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self help books</a>, so it‚Äôs actually self development blog of a self development essay.
            <br> Not necessarily bad for OK books, but since <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">I‚Äôm not a huge fan of 12 top self help books summary</a>, I must remain skeptical when it comes to the highest quality, heaviest life-hacks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No critical reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas focuses on interesting books to read in english. He provides self-development, but he does not go beserk like yours truly in finding faults, criticism and comparing notes with other interesting books to read in english.
            <br> That must not necessarily be a con though.
            <br> Depending on your point of view, that might even be a positive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 lessons learned format can be limiting</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas said he chose this format for ease of writing and for speed of execution.
            <br> That makes sense.
            <br> And i‚Äôm sure many appreciate the template which repeats for every best books about businessmen.
            <br> But as you might gather by now, I‚Äôm a pain in the as* type of reader and I prefer a more tailored approach. Why? Because, i<span style="font-size: inherit;">n my opinion, some top 100 books to read need more than 3 takeaways while some won‚Äôt even need 3 üôÇ</span></p>

        <p>This is a relatively new entry in the world of self development essay.
            <br> It uses a ‚Äú3 lessons learned‚Äù format similar to ‚Äúwww getabstract com book summary‚Äù, but <a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/">Self-development</a> has longer self-development synonym, ‚Äúreal‚Äù reviews and a more personalized approach.
            <br> That‚Äôs why, in spite of its current smaller offering of titles, I place it higher up in this list: it has greater potential.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High quality best books of all time for self development in short</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Which often include video embeds, pictures and helpful notes from the author.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn with Humor</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vince adds his personal touch for each reading books topic, making the read not only informational, but also fun and entertaining. A true breath of fresh air.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vince‚Äôs personality</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While perusing Vince‚Äôs blinkist for this review, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at this quote of his ‚Äú<a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/the-4-hour-body-summary/">The 4h Hour 12 top self help books summary</a>‚Äú, talking about Ferris‚Äô advice on sex:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I also learned during this best self help book summaries that at times, I‚Äôm still too immature to read things like this without giggling.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That‚Äôs right there an author who‚Äôs not pretending to be someone he‚Äôs not and is not afraid of being himself.
            <br> Reading Vince‚Äôs best self help book summaries feels in between reading self development articles and reading an well-written magazine article.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to grow the offering a bit</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>But that will come with time. And Vince might consider doing Self help summaries in a row on specific topics, which will help grow his expertise and make him more of an authority on specific niches.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span id="5_12Mincom">5. self-development synonym</span></h1>

        <p>As far as I understand, this was formerly known as ‚ÄúNuggets‚Äù and now it shifted its focus from simple quotes to full best books of all time for self development in short.
            <br> As of today, books summary read online is both best self help books 2019 and blinkist. And, as well, even a cool organizer of events in several world cities.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audiobook version of each reading books topic</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Longer top 100 books summary</strong>: on average, book to read provides 12 top self help books summary which are long enough to truly get to the core of what a book is about</li>
            <li><strong>Critical review in the end</strong>: 12min tries to combine both neutral book recommendations to personal touch by adding 100 best books ever in the end</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Somewhat politically correct best self help books 2019</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I find the personal 100 greatest books of all time bbc sometimes a bit too politically correct, as if in fear of offending the readers or the author.
            <br> That leaves their otherwise laudable personal touch more as a ‚Äúpost scriptum‚Äù addendum for SEO than a truly value-adding analysis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Book to read is&nbsp; read by robotic voice</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It‚Äôs better than nothing, but I wonder how many people actually end up listening to the famous books in the world read by a robot?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The writers are ‚Äú12min team‚Äù, it feels impersonal</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like book reviewers who put their face behind their business and their writers.
            <br> You can write to them, comment, understand where they come from‚Ä¶ And maybe even grab a drink one day with them.

        <p>Best self help books writes avhack life from the perspective of a guy who‚Äôs passionate about getting wiser and takes knowledge seriously.</p>
        <p>It categorizes goodreads into genres which allows the readers to dig deeper into a subject in a matter of hours.</p>
        <p>Since March 2019, you can sort both by category and by star rating.
            <br> It was a vision and dream of mine and it‚Äôs now live here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://thepowermoves.com/build-your-reading-list/">Books to read online</a></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I shouldn‚Äôt say this in public, but the truth is that you can use that page to sort through best business books of all time (2 and 3 stars) and focus on the very best of the best (4 and 5 stars).
            <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Note: I am dropping some of the 2 and 3 stars completely to focus more on quality. Some of do self development are locked for subscribers only.</span></p>
        <p>What I am most proud in my book recommendations is the highly critical approach I have for every book (or course) I review.</p>
        <p>Every time I smell BS or something doesn‚Äôt add up, I dig deeper to provide the readers with a red flag.
            <br> The idea is to help the readers -and myself- discern genuinely life-changing information from sales pitches and unscientific, made up or ‚Äúmassaged‚Äù claims.</p>
        <p>I also started doing interesting books to read on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves">Best books to read 2019</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves?sub_confirmation=1">subscribe here</a>) and you can follow new posts by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePowerMoves/">liking the Facebook page</a>, subscribing or by accepting the push notification (red bell on the bottom corner).</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Some success books summary were for himself, just so that he could&nbsp; remember more and come back to it in the future.
            <br> And some other times he‚Äôs in such a passionate rush of writing and sharing that he forgets the more methodical approach of proof-reading.
            <br> That can sometimes leave the flow of the prose to be desired.</p>

            <li><strong>Best books to read 2019</strong>: few and average quality</li>

        <p>When you write ‚Äúbest books to read 2019‚Äù on Google, interesting books to read in english is the first result. Which truly makes me wonder whether Google is seeking to deliver top quality first as it often claims it does.

        <p>Thomas Davies‚Äô book list are abundant. But they are mostly a list of bullet points.
