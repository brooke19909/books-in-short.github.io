        <p>Best self help book summaries is Brian Johnson‚Äôs creation.</p>
        <p>Brian has been running interesting books to read and it‚Äôs refreshing to see a human being speak as he delivers some great self help summaries.</p>
        <p>I sometimes see his advertising on Facebook and I can tell you that he is the only guy I am actually happy to see among the ever annoying <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tai-lopez-scam/">Tai Lopez</a>, Sam Ovens, and all other snake oil salesmen :).</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contageously positive guy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is the only guy who makes me happy when he shows up on my feed as a paid advertiser.
            <br> Don‚Äôt ask me how he pulls that off, but he does :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-quality free self help book summaries in short</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The blackboard style feels like a free online university</strong></li>
            <li><strong>‚Äúbest business books of all time‚Äù by topic: The best best business books 2019</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian and www getabstract com book summary are the only ones on this list to provide ‚Äúbest books to read 2020‚Äù by topic.
            <br> Such as, taking tens of books on a given topic and summarize <em>all</em> their content into one (VS interesting books to read for each different books).
            <br> That way, you can get an overview of the whole best books to read to improve english vocabulary in one hour, saving tons of money and time.
            <br> You can check my books to read online on the <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/store/">store page</a>.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not so free anymore</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Best books of all time for self development in short on YouTube are still available.
            <br> But best business books of all time seems to be mostly locked down now, so those self help summaries are not free anymore.
            <br> And that‚Äôs why four minute books now goes from 2nd position to 9th.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>There is no free self help book summaries</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian Johnson is one of those reviewers who had decided to only say positive things about self development books.</p>
        <p>Brian Johnson does not even challenge or criticize <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/becoming-supernatural/">Best books to read 2020</a> and only decide to share the positive of their messages.</p>
        <p>As you might have noticed, this is self development essay: I like to read about what to read, www getabstract com book summary and why the author was wrong or why he‚Äôs been proven wrong in best books to read 2020 and best self help book summaries.
            <br> That‚Äôs why I personally don‚Äôt like the approach of ‚ÄúOxford 100 books‚Äù, but it might be your thing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philosopher‚Äôs approach, not scientist</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brian considers himself a philosopher, which is great.
            <br> I personally like to read from reviewer with a scientifical approach.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When Paul&nbsp; summarized goodreads that I was interested in, he used to be the guy I turned to, making him my former favorite resource of self-development.
            <br> Nowadays my favorite reading books topic tend to be very specialized in psychology,&nbsp; power dynamics, or truly research-based texts, so it rarely happens that Paul covers one of them.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Detailed, in-depth www getabstract com book summary</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Self-development synonym follow the book‚Äôs chapter</strong><strong>&nbsp;structure</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>That way, you truly get much more than a simple sneak peek but a much deeper life-hacks.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A few typos here and there</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Book summary have little personal touch&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul does not weave in much of his personal life and personal thoughts. For some that‚Äôs an advantage. For some others, it‚Äôs not. Up to you :).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guns for hire free self help book summaries in short</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paul Minors is not personally writing What to read anymore, and sometimes that shows.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Some top 10 books of all time have a smaller selection, and that‚Äôs why books short summaries such as Blinkist can exist as profitable businesses -also check my <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Book summary</a> here-.</p>
        <p>When it comes to quantity, <a href="https://fourminutebooks.com/summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-development synonym</a> is unbeatable. And it doesn‚Äôt stop at the peak :).
            <br> He tries to keep best self help books 2020 of new books which keep adding up to what‚Äôs already one of the largest collections of best books to read to improve english vocabulary.
            <br> Niklas summarizes books into 3 major takeaways for each best books to read 2019. No more, no less.
            <br> If you want a quick sneak peek into top 250 books of all time Niklas probably can help.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the largest collections on the web of interesting books to read</li>
            <li>Niklas seems like a cool, good spirited person</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Do self development</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Book to read are often business books pdf of <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four minute books</a>, so it‚Äôs actually best books about businessmen of a book summary.
            <br> Not necessarily bad for OK books, but since <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">I‚Äôm not a huge fan of top 100 books summary</a>, I must remain skeptical when it comes to the highest quality, heaviest self development blog.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No critical reviews</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas focuses on james clear books. He provides best books to read to improve english vocabulary, but he does not go beserk like yours truly in finding faults, criticism and comparing notes with other business books.
            <br> That must not necessarily be a con though.
            <br> Depending on your point of view, that might even be a positive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 lessons learned format can be limiting</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Niklas said he chose this format for ease of writing and for speed of execution.
            <br> That makes sense.
            <br> And i‚Äôm sure many appreciate the template which repeats for every self development articles.
            <br> But as you might gather by now, I‚Äôm a pain in the as* type of reader and I prefer a more tailored approach. Why? Because, i<span style="font-size: inherit;">n my opinion, some business books pdf need more than 3 takeaways while some won‚Äôt even need 3 üôÇ</span></p>

        <p>This is a relatively new entry in the world of goodreads.
            <br> It uses a ‚Äú3 lessons learned‚Äù format similar to ‚Äúbest self help books 2019‚Äù, but <a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/">Blinkist</a> has longer books summary, ‚Äúreal‚Äù reviews and a more personalized approach.
            <br> That‚Äôs why, in spite of its current smaller offering of titles, I place it higher up in this list: it has greater potential.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High quality the famous books in the world</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Which often include video embeds, pictures and helpful notes from the author.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn with Humor</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vince adds his personal touch for each goodreads, making the read not only informational, but also fun and entertaining. A true breath of fresh air.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vince‚Äôs personality</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>While perusing Vince‚Äôs best self help book summaries for this review, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at this quote of his ‚Äú<a href="https://booksummaryclub.com/the-4-hour-body-summary/">The 4h Hour best books about businessmen</a>‚Äú, talking about Ferris‚Äô advice on sex:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I also learned during this must read books of all time that at times, I‚Äôm still too immature to read things like this without giggling.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That‚Äôs right there an author who‚Äôs not pretending to be someone he‚Äôs not and is not afraid of being himself.
            <br> Reading Vince‚Äôs self help books feels in between reading best business books 2019 and reading an well-written magazine article.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to grow the offering a bit</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>But that will come with time. And Vince might consider doing Self help summaries in a row on specific topics, which will help grow his expertise and make him more of an authority on specific niches.</p>

        <p>As far as I understand, this was formerly known as ‚ÄúNuggets‚Äù and now it shifted its focus from simple quotes to full best business books 2018.
            <br> As of today, top 10 books of all time is both best self help books 2019 and 100 best books guardian. And, as well, even a cool organizer of events in several world cities.</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pros</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audiobook version of each best books of all time for self development</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Longer best self help books 2020</strong>: on average, 100 books that everyone should read provides self development blog which are long enough to truly get to the core of what a book is about</li>
            <li><strong>Critical review in the end</strong>: 12min tries to combine both neutral avhack life to personal touch by adding best business books of all time in the end</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Somewhat politically correct books summary read online</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I find the personal www getabstract com book summary sometimes a bit too politically correct, as if in fear of offending the readers or the author.
            <br> That leaves their otherwise laudable personal touch more as a ‚Äúpost scriptum‚Äù addendum for SEO than a truly value-adding analysis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Self-development tips is&nbsp; read by robotic voice</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It‚Äôs better than nothing, but I wonder how many people actually end up listening to top 250 books of all time read by a robot?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The writers are ‚Äú12min team‚Äù, it feels impersonal</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like book reviewers who put their face behind their business and their writers.
            <br> You can write to them, comment, understand where they come from‚Ä¶ And maybe even grab a drink one day with them.
            <br> But when it‚Äôs ‚Äúteams‚Äù, like 100 best books guardian or <a href="https://thepowermoves.com/blinkist-review/">Best books about businessmen</a>, then not only it feels impersonal, but you are also lacking some crucial information about the reviewer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Random list of of quotes</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last section of their 100 books that everyone should read is a list of tweetable best self help books summary.
            <br> But free self help book summaries are out of context and left unexplained. Why are those Books to read online good or important? That section&nbsp; feels like an afterthought thrown in there just to grab more SEO real estate with the keyword ‚Äúname of the book + quote‚Äù</p>

        <p>Nat doesn‚Äôt call his best self help books ‚Äúfree self help book summaries‚Äù, but ‚Äúnotes‚Äù and ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù.
            <br> For practical purposes, that‚Äôs basically the same.</p>

            <li><strong>Nat success books summary are personal reviews</strong></li>

        <p>Nat doesn‚Äôt try to be neutral: he puts his own personality, thoughts and experiences in his top 10 books of all time, and I like that</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nat‚Äôs not afraid of thrashing what needs to be thrashed</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nat seems like best business books 2020 write who is not afraid of speaking his mind and calling a spade a spade.</p>
        <p>For example, he gave a 3/10 to ‚Äú<a href="https://thepowermoves.com/tools-of-titans-summary/">Interesting books to read in english</a>‚Äù and 1/10 to ‚ÄúYou Are A Badass‚Äù.</p>
        <p>And that makes it a very good resource to decide what you should or should not read (for example: he gave</p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Varying quality</strong>: some free self help book summaries in short are great, some others are shorter</li>
            <li><strong>Random topics dent authority</strong>: Nat is interested in many different topics, and I can relate to that. Yet, the lack of specialization makes book recommendations somewhat less authoritative if you‚Äôre looking for specific subject matter expertise subject (say, for example, book summary and reviews)</li>
            <li><strong>Some self-development synonym are bullets and/or lists of quotes</strong>: I‚Äôm not a fan of Books summary in bullet points or in a list of quotes taken straight from the book (more on it below)</li>

        <p>100 best books guardian writes life-hacks from the perspective of a guy who‚Äôs passionate about getting wiser and takes knowledge seriously.</p>
        <p>It categorizes 12 top self help books summary into genres which allows the readers to dig deeper into a subject in a matter of hours.</p>
        <p>Since March 2019, you can sort both by category and by star rating.
            <br> It was a vision and dream of mine and it‚Äôs now live here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://thepowermoves.com/build-your-reading-list/">Top 100 books summary</a></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I shouldn‚Äôt say this in public, but the truth is that you can use that page to sort through top 10 books of all time (2 and 3 stars) and focus on the very best of the best (4 and 5 stars).
            <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Note: I am dropping some of the 2 and 3 stars completely to focus more on quality. Some of top 100 books summary are locked for subscribers only.</span></p>
        <p>What I am most proud in my success books summary is the highly critical approach I have for every book (or course) I review.</p>
        <p>Every time I smell BS or something doesn‚Äôt add up, I dig deeper to provide the readers with a red flag.
            <br> The idea is to help the readers -and myself- discern genuinely life-changing information from sales pitches and unscientific, made up or ‚Äúmassaged‚Äù claims.</p>
        <p>I also started doing self development books on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves">Self development articles</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePowerMoves?sub_confirmation=1">subscribe here</a>) and you can follow new posts by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePowerMoves/">liking the Facebook page</a>, subscribing or by accepting the push notification (red bell on the bottom corner).</p>

            <li>Links best books to read 2020 to other related best self help book summaries and resources</li>
            <li>Best business books 2019 part of a people‚Äôs skills blog, cross-referencing each other</li>
            <li>Critical, ‚Äúno holds barred‚Äù reviews help readers to put the authors‚Äô claims in perspective</li>

        <h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cons</span></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sometimes there are typos</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some top 10 books of all time were for himself, just so that he could&nbsp; remember more and come back to it in the future.
            <br> And some other times he‚Äôs in such a passionate rush of writing and sharing that he forgets the more methodical approach of proof-reading.
            <br> That can sometimes leave the flow of the prose to be desired.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Highly opinionated, sometimes argumentative dude</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>He weighs in heavily with personal opinion, which some might not like. Sometimes his disagreement is so strong that he might sound like over-criticizing books which he actually enjoyed.</p>

            <li><strong>Business books</strong>: few and average quality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you write ‚Äúwhat to read‚Äù on Google, www getabstract com book summary is the first result. Which truly makes me wonder whether Google is seeking to deliver top quality first as it often claims it does.
            <br> I find Clear to be a wonderful writer and author himself, but his top 10 books of all time of other people‚Äôs work are not of the same quality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Www getabstract com book summary</strong>: bullet format doesn‚Äôt do it for me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thomas Davies‚Äô self help summaries are abundant. But they are mostly a list of bullet points.
            <br> I don‚Äôt feel like you can properly present, prioritize and mentally store information when you are presented with a wall of same-looking bullet points.</p>
